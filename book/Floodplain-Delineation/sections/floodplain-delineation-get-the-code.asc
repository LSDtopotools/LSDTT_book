=== Get the code for floodplain extraction

The code for floodplain delineation can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for identifying flood-prone areas using channel relief and slope thresholds.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  In this example it is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.  To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainDelineation.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/
----

==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainDelineation/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the floodplain delineation algorithm. In this tutorial we will work using a LiDAR dataset from Mid Bailey Run, Ohio. You can get it from our ExampleTopoDatasets repository using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Bailey_DEM.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Bailey_DEM.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the Mid Bailey Run DEM which will be used in these examples.

==== Get the example parameter files

We have also provided some examples parameter files that are used to run the floodplain delineation. You can get the example floodplain driver using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/tree/master/example_parameter_files/floodplain_bailey.driver
----

Once you have downloaded the example files you can put them in their own separate folder. We recommend creating a subfolder in the repository folder `LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction`, for example `LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/Bailey_data`.
