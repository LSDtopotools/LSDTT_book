=== Running the code

==== Compiling

Before the code can be run, you must compile it using the makefile in the folder `LSDTopoTools_FloodplainDelineation/driver_functions`.  Navigate to the folder using the command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd driver_functions/
----

and compile the code with:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f floodplain_delineation.make
----

This may come up with some warnings, but should create the file `floodplain_delineation.out`. You can then run the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./floodplain_delineation.out /path/to/DEM/location/ name_of_parameter_file.driver
----

For our example, the command would be:

[source,console]
----
$ ./floodplain_delineation.out /home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainDelineation/Bailey_data/ floodplain_bailey.driver
----

The program should take between 10 - 40 minutes to run, depending on the size of your DEM and your processing power.  Once it is completed, you will have a number of `bil` files which you can open in a GIS of your choice.  These files will include:

. *DEM_name_filtered.bil and .hdr*: The original DEM after Perona-Malik filtering
. *DEM_name_channel_relief.bil and .hdr*: A raster showing the relief of each pixel relative to the nearest channel
. *DEM_name_slope.bil and .hdr*: local slope for each pixel
. *DEM_name_qq_relief.txt*: A text file with data for creating quantile-quantile plots for channel relief
. *DEM_name_qq_slope.txt*: A text file with data for creating quantile-quantile plots for slope
. *DEM_name_CC_filt.bil and .hdr*: A raster file with the floodplain patches before additional processing
. *DEM_name_FP.bil and .hdr*: A raster file with the floodplain after processing (removal of patches not connected to the channel, and with holes in the mask filled in)

An example of the floodplain extracted from the Mid Bailey Run catchment is shown below. You should be able to get a raster similar to this by opening the file `DEM_name_FP.bil` in a GIS of your choice.

.Floodplain extracted for Mid Bailey Run, Ohio. The coordinate system is UTM Zone 17N.
