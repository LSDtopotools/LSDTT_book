=== Preliminary steps

==== Getting the channel head file

Before the floodplain extraction algorithm can be run, you must create a channel network for your DEM.  This can be done using the <<Channel extraction>> algorithms within LSDTopoTools.  There are several channel extraction algorithms which you can choose from: for more details please refer to the <<Channel extraction>> section.  Once you have run the channel extraction algorithm, you must make sure that the `csv` file with the channel head locations is placed in the same folder as the DEM you intend to use for floodplain identification.  You can move files to the folder using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ mv /path/to/channel/heads/file/channel_heads.csv /path/to/new/location/
----

For example, we can move the file `Bailey_CH.csv` from `/home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction` to our new folder:

[source,console]
----
$ mv /home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/Bailey_CH.csv /home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainDelineation/Bailey_data/
----

==== Finding the correct window size

Before we can run the floodplain extraction algorithm, we need to calculate the correct window size for calculating slope across the DEM.  This is used to calculate the thresholds for floodplain identification.  Please refer to the <<Selecting A Window Size>> section for information on how to calculate a window size for your DEM.

==== Creating the paramter file

In order to run the floodplain extraction code you must first create a parameter file for your DEM.  This should be placed in the same folder as your DEM and the channel heads `csv` file.  The file should have an identifying string, followed by a space, then the information for your DEM. The paramter file should be a named with the extension `.driver` with the following structure:


[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
.Structure of the parameter file. The rows *MUST* be in this order. 
|===
|Row number
|First Column (value goes in second column)
|Data type
|Description

|1
|DEM_ID
|String
|Name of your DEM

|2
|CN_name
|String
|Name of the channel heads file (actually the suffix, which gets added to DEM_ID)

|3
|Minimum_Slope Minimum
|float
|Minimum slope for filling the DEM, suggested to be 0.0001

|4
|Threshold_SO
|int
|Threshold stream order for identifying floodplains, suggested to be 3.

|5
|FilterTopo
|bool
|Binary switch for whether to carry out filtering of the DEM.  This should be set to 1 unless you are repeating the analysis, in which case you can set it to 0 to speed up the process.

|6
|Radius_Surface_Fitting
|float
|Window size for calculating the slope in metres. 

|7
|Radius_Floodplain_Filling
|pixels
|Window radius for filling holes in the floodplain mask (post-processing step). Suggested to be 50 pixels for 1m data.

|8
|ThresholdCondition
|float
|Percentage at which to select threshold from quantile-quantile plots. Should be set to 0.005.

|9
|LowerPercentile
|float
|Lower percentile for fitting normal distribution to quantile-quantile plot. Should be set to 25.

|10
|UpperPercentile
|float
|Upper percentile for fitting normal distribution to quantile-quantile plot. Should be set to 75.
