== Floodplain delineation using channel relief and slope thresholds

Identifying areas prone to flooding is essential for a number of disciplines, including geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology.  In LSDTopoTools we have a geomorphic method of identifying flood-prone areas.  Unlike common hydrological modelling methods, our geomorphic method is fast to run on large DEMs and does not require validation with independent datasets.  It identifies flood-prone areas based on two thresholds: relief relative to the nearest channel, and local slope.  These thresholds are determined statistically from the DEM using quantile-quantile plots, and do not have to be set by the user.  

The method has several steps, which are outlined below:

. The DEM is filtered using a Perona-Malik filter, a non-linear filter. For more details please refer to http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=56205[Perona and Malik (1990)]. This filter was chosen as it reduces micro-topographic noise while preserving sharp boundaries, such as between hillslopes and floodplains.
. After filtering, the local slope and relief relative to the nearest channel are calculated for each pixel.  To calculate the relief relative to the channel, a threshold stream order must be set to ensure that small first order tributaries are not selected.
. Thresholds for slope and channel relief are calculated statistically from the DEM using quantile-quantile plots.  This involves plotting the probability density function of each metric and calculating the deviation away from a reference normal distribution.
. Any pixel with a value lower than both the channel relief and slope threshold is then classified as floodplain, giving a binary mask of 1 (floodplain) and 0 (not floodplain).
. A connected components algorithm (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4472694[He et al. (2008)]) is then run to identify all patches of floodplain that are connected to a channel. Any pixels not connected to a channel are removed from the mask
. Finally, any holes in the floodplain mask are filled.  A filling radius must be specified by the user.

NOTE: This method is in development, and the code will be released on our GitHub when the method has been published.

*****************************************************************************

Here is a quick overview of how to set up and run the code, if you have done it before:

. Choose the channel extraction method that you would like to use.
. Make sure your DEM is in `bil` format and is in the repository folder
. Create a parameter file for your DEM
. Make sure you have created a channel network for your DEM, and have the `_CH` file in your repository.
. Compile the code using `make -f floodplain_delineation.make`
. Run the program with `./floodplain_delineation.out /path_to_data_folder/ parameter_file.driver`
. Open the resulting `bil` files in the GIS of your choice.
