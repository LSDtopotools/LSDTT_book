=== Running your first analysis

We are going to run the first example on some example data.

==== First analysis: example data

Navigate into your data folder and download the data using the http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[wget] tool

[source,console]
----
$ wget http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/export_data/WhiteadderDEM.tif
----

This data is in `.tif format! Quite a lot of the data you might download from the web is in this format.
LSDTopoTools doens't read `tif` files (that is a job for the future), so *you need to convert to a valid file format*.
We will convert the data using GDAL: see the section <<translating-your-raster-into-something-that-can-be-used-by-lsdtopotoolbox>>.

To convert the data to ENVI `bil` format (which is our preferred format) type:

[source,console]
----
$ gdal_translate -of ENVI WhiteadderDEM.tif WhiteadderDEM.bil
----

Now, see if the file is there::

[source,console]
----
$ ls
WhiteadderDEM.bil          WhiteadderDEM.hdr
WhiteadderDEM.bil.aux.xml  WhiteadderDEM.tif
----

If you looked at the file in a GIS you might have additional files with the extension `.aux.xml`.
The importnat thing is that you now have files with the extensions `bil` and `hdr`.

Important: There are two formats that use the file extension `bil`: the *ENVI* format (which is the one we use)
and an *ESRI* format. Make sure your `bil` files are in *ENVI* format.
You can always check using `gdalinfo`.

==== Placing the paramfile

The code is flexible enough that the parameter file can be in a different
location from the data, but I think it is good practice to keep the parameter
files with the data. The parameter file not only runs the software, but
*more importantly it is a reproducible record of your analyses!* So if you are
doing research you should save these files. The software is designed so that
if you send someone else the parameter file and the DEM they can reproduce
your analysis exactly. This differentiates our software from GUI driven
software like ArcMap and QGIS.

Okay, lets actually move the file. An example file came with the source code.
You can use the cp` command to make a copy of this file in your data folder.

Note:Your directories will have different names than those shown here so
modify the paths shown below appropriately:

[source,console]
----
$ cp /home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver/Example.LSDTT_driver Example.LSDTT_driver
----

You can check to see if the file is there:

[source,console]
----
$ ls
Example.LSDTT_driver  WhiteadderDEM.bil.aux.xml  WhiteadderDEM.tif
WhiteadderDEM.bil     WhiteadderDEM.hdr
----

We will use `Example.LSDTT_driver` as a template, but will want to change some of the values in that file.
You might want to keep the original, so we suggest making a copy of the parameter file:

[source,console]
----
cp Example.LSDTT_driver Whiteadder.LSDTT_driver
----
