=== Preparing your data and folders

Don't be messy!
Your life will be much more pleasant if you set up a sensible directory structure before your start performing analyses.
The programs in LSDTopoTools allow you to both read and write data from directories of your choice,
so there is no need to pile everything in one directory.
In fact, we would recommend keeping your data quite separate from the code.

.If you set up using vagrant
************************************************
If you set up using vagrant, it means you will have a folder called `Topographic_projects`:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/$ cd /LSDTopoTools
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools$ ls
fftw-3.3.4  fftw-3.3.4.tar.gz  Git_projects  Topographic_projects
----

In the `Topographic_projects` directory will be a subfolder called `Test_data` with 3 DEMs.
We will use these for the tutorials. However if you are doing your own work you might set up additional directories.

.Terminal window cheat sheet
************************************************
Here are some commands and shortcuts that you will find useful while using the terminal window.
They are things that work in Linux (and should therefore work on OSX, since it is built on Linux).
Not all will work in a Windows powershell, which is why if you are running Windows we recommend,
creating a <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,virtual Linux machine>> on your Windows computer.
Useful commands are:

* Navigate to a directory: `$ cd /directory/name/`.
* Go down a directory level: `$ cd ..`
* See what directory you are in: `$ pwd`
* See what files are in this directory: `$ ls`
* Copy a file: `cp /my/directory/a.file /another/directory/new.filename`
* Move a file: `mv /my/directory/a.file /another/directory/new.filename`

There are also a number of keyboard shortcuts that are useful:

* Use `tab` to autocomplete (start typing a filename and hit tab and Linux will complete the filename for you!)
* Use `ctrl-a` to go to the beginning of a line in the terminal.
* Use `ctrl-e` to go to the end of a line in the terminal.
* Use the up and dawn arrows to go through your history of commands.
* If you highlight text with you mouse you can hit the center mouse button to copy text.
************************************************

How you organize your directories is, of course, up to you, but we can gently suggest a directory structure.
Because LSDTopoTools is distributed from several different https://github.com/LSDtopotools[GitHub repositories],
It probably makes sense to make one directory to house all the different repositories,
and another to house your data.

The tutorials will be based on a structure where the repositories are located in a folder `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects` and the data is located in a folder `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects`.
If you have a different directory structure just substitute in your directories when running the examples.
If you do this for a living (like we do), you might want to set up a sensible structure for you topographic data,
for example by having folders for the type of data, e.g.:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/
$ ls
Aster30m    SRTM90m
lidar       IfSAR
SRTM30m     Test_data
----

NOTE: Only /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data is created automatically with our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles].

If you used the vagrant setup, the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` folder will contain 3 DEMs:
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
$ ls
gabilan.bil  gabilan.hdr  Mandakini.bil  Mandakini.hdr  WA.bil  WA.hdr
----

I highly recommend using some system to organize your data. Personally, I've arranged by data type (lidar, IfSAR, SRTM, etc.) and then geographically, e.g.:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
home/topographic_data/
$ cd lidar
$ ls
California
Colorado
Italy
Switzerland
----

The way you organize this data is totally up to you,
but you will save yourself from substantial amounts of stress later if you set up a sensible directory structure from the start.
