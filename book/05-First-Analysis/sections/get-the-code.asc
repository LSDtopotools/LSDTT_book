=== Get and compile your first LSDTopoTools program

NOTE: This code is downloaded automatically by our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfile].
If you have used that to get started then you can skip to the <<Compile the code>> section. 

Okay, the first step is to navigate to the folder where you will keep your repositories.
In this example, that folder is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.
In a terminal window, go there with the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the `pwd` command to make sure you are in the correct directory.
If you don't have the directory, use `mkdir` to make it.

==== Clone the code from Git

Now, clone the repository from https://github.com[GitHub].
The repository in the first example is here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver.
The command to clone is:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver.git
----

==== If you would rather not use `git`

Perhaps you feel like being difficult and have decided not to use `git`,
because you find its name offensive or because https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds[Linus Torvalds] once threw an apple core at your cat.

In that case you can download a zipped version of the repository, and unzip it

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

==== Compile the code

If you are starting with our vagrant box, you can go directly to the correct folder with:

[source,console]
----
cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----

If you have cloned from git on your own, you will still be sitting in the directory
`/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/`, so navigate up to the directory `LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver/`.

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ cd LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver
$ cd Analysis_Driver
----

You can now compile the code with

[source,console]
----
$ make -f Drive_analysis_from_paramfile.make
----

I am afraid there will be a lot of warnings. We apologize for being naughty programmers.
Note if there is an error then that is a problem! You'll need to contact Simon or post a comment on the github repo. 
However, after all of those warnings you should be able to type `ls` and see a program called `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out`.

The last message from the of the compilation should say this:


[source,console]
----
g++ -Wall -O3 -g  Drive_analysis_from_paramfile.o ../LSDIndexRaster.o ../LSDRaster.o ../LSDFlowInfo.o ../LSDStatsTools.o ../LSDJunctionNetwork.o ../LSDIndexChannel.o ../LSDChannel.o ../LSDMostLikelyPartitionsFinder.o ../LSDShapeTools.o ../LSDAnalysisDriver.o -o LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out
----


*Congratualtions!* You have compiled your first LSDTopoTools program. You are now ready to do some analysis.
