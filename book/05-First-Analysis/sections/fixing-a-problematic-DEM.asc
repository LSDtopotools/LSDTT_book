=== Fixing a DEM with nodata problems

The topographic data we have supplied as default with *LSDTopoTools* is well behaved (we have checked) but data from other sources can have all kinds of problems. Some problems are so common that we have written a program just to fix these problems:

* The nodata values have not registered properly.
* There are nodata holes in the middle of your data. 

To fix this there is a program called `DEM_preprocessing.cpp` that comes in the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver[`LSDTopoTool_AnalysisDriver` repository]. 

These instructions assume you have used our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant,vagrant setup>>. 

==== Make the program. 

Go into the driver function folder, and make the program:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
$ make -f DEM_preprocessing.make
----

This will compile into a prgram called *DEM_preprocessing.exe*

==== Run the preprocessing program


You give *DEM_preprocessing.exe* a text file with information about what you want it to do. You need to tell the program where this file is and its name. If the file name is `DEMPP.driver` and it is sitting with your data files in the directory `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` then you would call the program with

[source,console]
----
$ ./DEM_preprocessing.exe /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data/ DEMPP.driver 
----

The `.driver` file looks a bit like this:

[source,paramfile]
----
# Parameters for pre-rpocessing DEMs
# Comments are preceeded by the hash symbol
# Documentation can be found here: 

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doens't exist. 
read path: /LSDTopTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
write path: /LSDTopTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
read fname: CrapDEM
write fname: CrapDEM
----

The components of this file are hopfully self explanitory: you will need to update the read and write paths and the read and write fnames (these are the prfixes of your DEM) to reflect your own messed up DEM. 

To see all the options you should refer to our appendix on <<DEM preprocessing Options>>.
