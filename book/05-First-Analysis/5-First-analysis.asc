== First Analysis

.If you have jumped directly to here
************************************************
You might be so eager to start that you have jumped directly here without reading any of the background material.
This is fine as long as you know what you are doing!

If you followed the instrcutions here: <<Installing LSDTopoTools on a Windows machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>, 
then you will have all of the necessary software installed apart from python. 

To start this chapter, you should:

** Make sure you can open a *terminal or powershell window*.
** Make sure you have a *pass:[C++] compiler* (we use `pass:[g++]`) and the *make tool* installed.
** Make sure you have *git* installed.
** Make sure you have the *GDAL utilities* installed and working.
** Get some topographic data and convert it to *projected coordinates* (we prefer WGS1984 UTM projections).
** Make sure you have *python* with *scipy* including *numpy* and *matplotlib* working on your computer. 
Note that our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles] do not install python: you should install that on your host computer (as opposed to the client Ubuntu machine set up by Vagrant).
************************************************

If you understand all of the preliminary steps, you are ready to move on to your first analysis.
If not, the previous chapters will get you up to speed.

=== Summary

By now you should be able to clone one of our programs from Github, compile it, and run it on your computer.
Now we can move on to more complex topographic analyses.
