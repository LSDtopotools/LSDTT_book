=== LSDTopoTools python mapping functions

We have written a series of lightweight mapping tools in python for 
visualising data. 
These tool are for times when you cannot be bothered waiting for a GIS
to load, or when you want a perfectly reproducable, code-driven visualisation. 

To make these work, you will need matplotlib and the gdal python packages
installed on your system.
