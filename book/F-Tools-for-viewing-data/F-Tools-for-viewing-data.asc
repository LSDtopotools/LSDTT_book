== Tools for viewing data

The many analyses provided by LSDTopoTools produce geographic data 
(that is data that is attached to some location in space). 
In this section we provide some basic instruction on how to view this
data, using either Geographic Information Sysems (GISs) or
using our own visualisation scripts, which are written in python.

=== Summary

You should now be able to perform basic operations such as loading and exploring data in QGIS, ArcMap or our own python tools.
