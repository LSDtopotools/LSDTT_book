=== Processing High Resolution Topography

The generation of E* R* data is built upon the ability to measure hillslope length and relief as spatially continuous variables across a landscape. This is performed by using the hillslope length driver outlined in the <<Extracting Hillslope Lengths>> chapter.

NOTE: When running the hillslope length driver, ensure that the switch to write the rasters is set to `1` as these rasters are required by the `E_R_STAR.cpp` driver.


=== Input Data

This driver takes the following input data:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
.Input data for the `ER_STAR.cpp` driver.
|===
|Input data
|Input type
|Description

|Raw DEM
|A raster named `<prefix>_DEM.flt`.
|The raw DEM to be analysed.

|Channel Heads
|Channel head raster named `<prefix>_DEM_CH.flt`.
|A file containing channel heads, which can be generated using the http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DrEICH_algorithm[DrEICH algorithm]. See the <<Channel Extraction>> chapter for more information.

|Minimum Patch Area
|An integer
|

|Minimum Number of Basin Data Points
|An integer
|

|Basin Order
|An integer

=== Compile The Driver

Once you have generated the hillslope length data you must compile the `E_R_STAR.cpp` driver. This is performed by using the provided makefile, `LH_Driver.make` and the command:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f ER_STAR.make
----

Which will create the binary file, `ER_STAR.out` to be executed.
