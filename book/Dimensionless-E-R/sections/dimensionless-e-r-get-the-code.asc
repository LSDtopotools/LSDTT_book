=== Get the code for dimensionless erosion and relief analysis

Our code for E*R* analysis can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for extracting channel networks, generating hillslope length data and processing this topographic data into a form which can be used to generate E* R* relationships.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  In this example it is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.  To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ER_STAR.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ER_STAR/
----

==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ER_STAR/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the Python code

In addition to the topographic analysis code, some python code is provided to handle the generation of the E* R* data and its visualization. This code is stored in a separate https://github.com[GitHub] repository which can be checked out in the same manner as before. It is a good idea to place the python code into a separate directory to avoid confusion later on.

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/sgrieve/ER_Star.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd ER_STAR/
----

or if you prefer to avoid _git_:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ER_STAR/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

IMPORTANT: The python code has a number of dependences which you should check prior to trying to run the code, as it could give confusing error messages.

==== Checking your Python package versions



==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test this algorithm. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset and accompanying channel heads from Gabilan Mesa, California. You can get it from our ExampleTopoDatasets repository using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/gabilan.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/gabilan.hdr
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/gabilan_CH.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/gabilan_CH.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format).
