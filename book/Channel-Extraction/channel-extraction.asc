== Channel extraction

Landscapes are almost always dissected by a network of channels, 
and extracting channel networks from topographic data is a common yet frequently challenging task in topographic analysis.  We have a variety of different channel network extraction algorithms that can be used depending on the characteristics of the landscape to be studied (such as the relief and presence of artifical features), or the resolution of the available digital elevation models (DEMs).
In this chapter we go through the many methods of channel extraction available within [LSDTopoTools], 
ranging from rudimentary methods (e.g., <<Basic channel extraction using thresholds>>) 
to methods that aim to precicely locate channel heads from high resolution data.

=== Summary

By now you should be able to extract channel networks using a variety of methods. For coarse-resolution DEMs you can extract the channel network using a simple area threshold, although the choice of threshold must be carefully considered. For higher-resolution DEMs you can use either a geometric method (if you are interested in extracting the valley network), or a process-based method such as the DrEICH algorithm (if you are interested in the fluvial domain).  These methods all require a certain number of user-defined parameters, so the user should take care to select these carefully as their value may impact the resulting channel network.
