== Channel extraction

Landscapes are almost always dissected by a network of channels, 
and extracting channel networks from topographic data is a common yet frequently challenging task in topographic analysis.
In this chapter we go through the many methods of channel extraction available within [LSDTopoTools], 
ranging from rudimentary methods (e.g., <<Basic channel extraction using thresholds>>) 
to methods that aim to precicely locate channel heads from high resolution data.
