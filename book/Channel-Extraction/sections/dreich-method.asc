=== Channel extraction using the Dreich method

The http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013WR015167/abstract[Driech method] 
of channel head extraction aims to find channel heads by looking at the break in the properties of topographic profiles 
that occur when fluvial incision gives way to hillslope sediment transport processes.
