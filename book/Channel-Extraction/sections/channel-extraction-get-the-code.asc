=== Get the code for channel extraction

Our code for channel extraction can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for extracting channel networks using a variety of different methods ranging from simple contributing area thresholds to more complex geometric and theoretical approaches for extracting channels from high-resolution datasets.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  In this example it is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.  To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/
----

==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the channel extraction algorithms. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset from Indian Creek, Ohio. You can get it from our ExampleTopoDatasets repository using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/indian_creek.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/indian_creek.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). Figure 1 below shows a shaded relief map of the Indian Creek DEM which will be used in these examples.
