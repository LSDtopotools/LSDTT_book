=== Get the code for channel extraction

Our code for channel extraction can be found in our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction[GitHub repository].  This repository contains code for extracting channel networks using a variety of different methods ranging from simple contributing area thresholds to more complex geometric and theoretical approaches for extracting channels from high-resolution datasets.

.If you use our vagrantfiles
*************************************
If you use our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles] to set up your system, the channel extraction repository will already be downloaded onto your virtual machine.
You can find the repository in the directory `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/` directory. You can use `cd` to go directly there. 
*************************************

==== Clone the GitHub repository

If you haven't run our vagrant setup, you need to clone the repository. First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  In this example it is called `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/`.  To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/
----

==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the channel extraction algorithms. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset from Indian Creek, Ohio. It is a bit large so we don't include it with the standard test datasets. If you are using our vagrant server, you should go into the test data folder and download it using wget:

.If you are using a Vagrant server
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
----

Then you can download the data from our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets[ExampleTopoDatasets repository] using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/indian_creek.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/indian_creek.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the Indian Creek DEM which will be used in these examples.

NOTE: You can also work with the DEM `gabilan.bil` that is included by default in the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` folder but you will need tochange the parameter files to reflect the different DEM name. 

==== Get the example parameter files

We have also provided some examples parameter files that are used to run each method of channel extraction.  You can check out the entire folder of example parameter files using subversion by typing the following in the command line:

[source,console]
----
$ svn checkout https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/trunk/example_parameter_files/ExampleFiles_ChannelExtraction
----

If you don't have subversion you can use wget to get the individual files (this must be done separately for each file) e.g.

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/tree/master/example_parameter_files/ExampleFiles_ChannelExtraction/indian_creek_dreich.driver
----

Once you have downloaded the example files then put them in the repository folder `LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction`.
