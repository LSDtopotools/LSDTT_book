=== Basic channel extraction using thresholds

One of the most simple ways of extracting channel networks from DEMs uses a contributing area threshold.  This method is useful for coarse resolution (e.g. >10m) DEMs, where topographic features of the channel heads themselves cannot be reliably identified from the DEM. The user has to specify the threshold area, which represents the upstream area that must drain to a pixel before it is considered as part of the channel.

NOTE: The area threshold chosen will affect the density of the channel network.  This should be considered carefully, and compared against field-mapped channel head data if these are available.

We will work through an example using the Indian Creek example dataset that you downloaded.

==== Compile the code

We can extract threshold area channel networks using the driver function called `channel_extraction_area_threshold.cpp`.  To compile the code you first need to navigate to the driver functions folder in the repository.  When in this folder type the following to compile the driver:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f channel_extraction_area_threshold.make
----

This will create a program called `channel_extraction_area_threshold.out`

==== Run the analysis

To run the analysis you first need to create a parameter file, with which we will set the key user-defined parameters.  To create your parameter file, open any text editor and create a file with the following lines:

[source,paramfile]
----
Name of the DEM without extension
Minimum slope for filling the DEM (suggested to be 0.0001)
Threshold area for channel extraction 
----

The threshold area must be given in m^2^.  You need to save this parameter file in the folder `LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction` (one folder above the driver functions folder).  For the Indian Creek site we can create a parameter file called `indian_creek.driver` with the following lines:

[source,paramfile]
----
indian_creek
0.0001
1000
----

After creating the parameter file we can then run the code using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ ./channel_extraction_area_threshold.out /path_to_driver_folder/ param_file_name
----

For our Indian Creek example our command would be:

[source,console]
----
$ ./channel_extraction_area_threshold.out /home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction/ indian_creek.driver
----

Once this program has run, it will create several files with the extracted channel network.  These include:

** A CSV file with the channel heads e.g. `indian_creek_CH_nodeindices_for_arc.csv`
** A `bil` file with the channel heads e.g. `indian_creek_CH.bil`
** A `bil` file with the stream network with Strahler stream ordering e.g. `indian_creek_SO.bil`

Figure 2 shows the extracted channel network for the Indian Creek field site with a threshold of 1000 m^2^.
