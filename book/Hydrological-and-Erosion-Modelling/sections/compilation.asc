=== Compilation

Several versions of the make file are provided, for different situations. It is planned in the future to make a single proper makefile with different options that cover the separate versions at present.

1. CatchmentModel.make
2. CatchmentModel_Optimised.make
3. CatchmentModel_OpenMP_Optimised.make

The plain makefile contains all the flags for debugging and profiling. (The program will run slower if you use this version). The optimised version runs with the -O2 flags and no profiler or debugger information. The OpenMP version is for running the code in parallel on multiple cores.

[source,console]
----
make -f CatchmentModel.make
----

If you want to start again and remove the object and executable files, there is also a clean command:

[source,console]
----
make -f CatchmentModel.make clean
----

==== Dependencies

Your compiler must support C++11. Almost all do as of 2016, as long as you are running a fairly recent version. The C++11 flag is included in the makefile. The code uses some features of the C++11 language standard, but you don't need to worry about them if you don't want.

The parallel version of the code uses the OpenMP libraries, which are powerful (and somewhat magical...) libraries for compiling the code to run in parallel. You may need to install the `gcc-devel` package on linux, if using gcc. Again, the compiler flag is taken care of in the makefile. The code has been tested on the gcc and intel compilers.

All other libraries are supplied with the source code (The TNT and FFT libraries, which provide various mathematical functions). You do not need to install them separately.
