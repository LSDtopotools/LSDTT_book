=== Parameter File

The parameter file is read by the CatchmentModel program when it starts, setting the variables for various components of the model, as well as the names of the DEM files and supplementary input files needed for the model simulation. It is a plain text file and can be called anything you like. By convention, the example parameter file supplied with the code has the suffix `.params`, but you may use whatever you like. 

Anything in the parameter file preceded by a `#` will be treated as a comment. You are free to comment away in the parameter file to your heart's content. 

The order of the parameters in the parameter file is not strict, but we stick to the convention used in the sample file for reference here. The parameter names must not be changed, and must be lowercase.

|===
|Parameter Name
|Units/Data Type
|Description

|read_fname
|text
|The name of your DEM that will act as the terrain surface in the model. Do not give the extension here.

|dem_read_extension
|text
|The extension of the input DEM. Only ASCII (asc) is currently supported, we are working on supporting other input formats soon.

|dem_write_extension
|text
|The format to save output rasters in. Supported choices are: 'asc' or 'flt' (binary). 'bil' also works but no georeferencing is supported yet.

|read_path
|text
|The path where your input files can be found

|write_path
|text
|The path where your output files will be written

|write_fname
|text
|A name for the output timeseries file. You can supply your own extension, but it will always be a plain text file.

|timeseries_save_interval
|model minutes/integer
|Will record a timeseries record (new row) every X minutes in model time. The timeseries output contains the discharge of water and sediment.

3+|SUPPLEMENTARY INPUT

|hydroindex_file
|text
|The hydroindex file name (with extension). Only ascii (asc) currently supported.

|rainfall_data_file
|text
|The rainfall data file name (with extension). Must be a plain text file.

|grain_data_file
|text
|Name of your grain data input file.

|bedrock_data_file
|text
|Name of the bedrock DEM. If specified, this DEM (ascii only) will be loaded as a solid bedrock layer beneath your top-layer terrain DEM. It's up to the use to make sure the elevations are lower than the top layer!

3+|NUMERICAL

|min_time_step
|model seconds, integer
|The minimum timestep used in the model

|max_time_step
|model seconds, integer
|Maximum timestep used by model. Should not really be higher than your rainfall data interval, otherwise you will skip input data.

|max_run_duration
|model hours, integer
|Length of your simulation, minus 1. (So for a 72 hour simulation, enter '71' here.) This is a weird quirk that will be fixed in a later release.

|memory_limit
|
|Ignore, leave at 1.

3+|SEDIMENT

|transport_law
|text
a|Can either be *wilcock* or *einstein*. Determines which sediment transport law is used by the model.

|max_tau_velocity
|meters/second
|Limits the maximum velocity used to calculate sediment transport. The default is 5. It is rarely invoked except in very steep slopes.

|active_layer_thickness
|metres
a|This controls the thickness of layer representing the surface, bedload or subsurface. It should be around 0.1 to 0.2. It must be at least 4 times the *erode_limit* parameter. (See below)

|chann_lateral_erosion
|
a|In channel lateral erosion rate. Prevents overdeepening feedback. http://www.showme.com/sh/?i=24567[See explanation here]

|erode_limit
|metres
|Maximum erosion limit per cell (or deposition). Prevents numerical instabilities by transferring too much between cell to cell. Should be around 0.01 for 10m or less DEMs, slightly higher for coarse DEMs.

|suspended_sediment_on
|boolean (yes/no)
|Turns on suspended sediment for the first fraction only at present.

|read_in_graindata_from_file
|boolean (yes/no)
|Reads in the initial grain size data from a file. Normally the initial distribution of grainsizes is uniform across the landscape if this is not specified.

3+|LATERAL EROSION OPTIONS

|lateral_erosion_on
|boolean (yes/no)
|Turns on lateral erosion in channels (UNTESTED)

|lateral_erosion_const
|
|See Coulthard and Van de Wiel (2007) for details. This parameter sets the lateral erosion rates, and ought to be calibrated to a field site. Values can ramge from 0.01-0.001 for braided rivers; 0.0001 for meandering channels. This value is grid cell size independent.

|edge_smoothing_passes
|integer
|Determines how well smoothed the curvature of the channels will be. Should be set as the frequency of meanders/distance between two meanders in grid cell size.

|downstream_cell_shift
|integer
a|The gradient used to determine lateral erosion rates can be shifted downstream, allowing meander bars and bends to migrate down channel. Suggested values are around 10% of the *edge_smoothing_passes* parameter. So around 1-5.

|lateral_cross_chan_smoothing
|
|The maximum difference allowed in the the cross channel smoothing of edge values. After calculating the radius of curvature for the outside of a meander bend, the model must interpolate this value to determine how much sediment can be moved laterally. Smaller values result in better cross channel gradients, but take up more CPU time. Typical default value is 0.0001. If your channels are well resolved by DEM resolution, you may need to reduce by an order of magnitude.

3+|HYDROLOGY

|hydro_model_only
|boolean (yes/no)
|Runs the model as a hydrological/flood inundation model only if set to yes. Will turn off all the erosion routines and terrain will be fixed. Speeds up run times considerably.

|topmodel_m_value
|
a|As well as the water routing sub-model, LSDCatchmentModel also calculates the discharge based on Beven's TOPMODEL (i.e. discharge approximation based on drainage area and topography. The model contains the infamous **m** parameter, which varies depending on environment. You should consult the literature for appropriate values.

TIP: For catchment mode this is an important variable as it controls the peak and duration of the hydrograph generated by a rain event. It is the  same as the 'm' value in TOPMODEL, that CAESAR-lisflood's hydrological model is based on. Typical values for m are from 0.02 (low - meaning low flood peaks and long duration hydrographs) to 0.005 (higher, flashier peaks) and examples of values used can be found in the CAESAR and TOPMODEL literature.

|in_out_difference
|cumecs
|If greater than 0, allows the model to run faster in periods of hydrological steady state. If the difference between water entering the catchment and water leaving the catchment is equal to or less than this value, the model will increase the time step. The time step will then be determined by erosional and depositional processes, which are typically much slower acting. Can be set to a low mean annual flow value for the river. 

|min_q_for_depth_calc
|cumecs
|Threshold for calculating flow depths. The model will not calculate flow depths when the discharge at a cell is below this value, avoiding CPU time spent calculating incredibly small flow amounts. Should be set to approximately 10% of grid cell size. e.g 0.5 for a 50m DEM.

|max_q_for_depth_calc
|cumecs
|An upper discharge threshold that will prevent water being added above the given discharge threshold. Typically 1000.0, but lowering the value will shift the balance of water being added to the headwaters, rather than lower down through the catchment. 

|water_depth_erosion_threshold
|metres
|If water depths are below this threshold, the model will not calculate erosion for that cell in that timestep. Used to prevent CPU time being spent on incredibly small amounts of erosion calculations.

|slope_on_edge_cell
|
|The slope used to calculate water flow on the edge of the DEM (since there is no neighbouring cell to calculate the downstream gradient. You should set this to approximately the same as the average channel gradient near the outlet of your river.

|evaporation_rate
|
|Untested/unimplemented yet

|courant_number
|
|Controls the numerical stability and execution speed of the flow model. See Bates et al (2009). Typical values should be between 0.3 and 0.7. Higher values will speed up the model, but are more unstable. Parameter is dependent on grid cell size. DEMs of 20-50m resolution can use values of 0.7, finer DEMs (e.g. <2m) will need the lowest value of 0.3, but do not set it lower than 0.3.

|froude_num_limit
|
|Restricts flow between cells per time step, as too much can lead to checkerboarding effects. If this happens the froude number can be lowered. The default value of 0.8 results in subcritical flow - flow dominated by gravitational forces and behving in a slow or stable way. A value of 1 results in critical flow, which may be ok for shallow flows at coarse grid cell resolutions. Note that reducing flow with the Froude number will reduce the speed of a flood wave moving downstream.

|mannings_n
|
|A roughness coefficient used by the flow model. http://www.fsl.orst.edu/geowater/FX3/help/8_Hydraulic_Reference/Mannings_n_Tables.htm[Values can be looked-up here.]

|hflow_threshold
|metres
|This threshold prevents water being routed between adjacent cells when the gradient is incredibly small. A good default value is 0.00001.
