=== Origins: relation to CAESAR-Lisflood

The model is based on a 'light', stripped-down pass:[C++] translation of the CAESAR-Lisflood model. Unlike the CAESAR model, there is no graphical user interface (GUI), as in keeping with the LSDTopoTools mantra, the code is designed to be run from a command line, console, or terminal interace. This helps facilitate geomorphic modelling that is not dependent on a series of mouse-clicks, or propriatary operating systems and libraries. The Catchment Model code can be run on a range of operating systems and computing platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows. However, GUIs can be useful for modelling, so if you would prefer to use a model in GUI-mode then https://sourceforge.net/projects/caesar-lisflood/[CAESAR-Lisflood] is a good choice for this. The LSDCatchmentModel model is designed to reproduce some of the core functionality in CAESAR-Lisflood, while being faster and cross platform, and to scale up to running on a supercomputer if the resources are available to you. One of the limitations for some users of CAESAR-Lisflood is that you need a dedicated Windows box to do your simulations, and you can't send them off to a cluster computer-type facility, which typically run Unix-based operating systems. (Unless you have a bunch of spare Windows PCs...) 

With the LSDTopoTools implementation you can also perform topographic analysis within the same software environment, switching easily between modelling and topographic analysis outputs.

NOTE: There is no current plan to maintain the code in tandem with CAESAR-Lisflood. LSDCatchmentModel was spun-off at CL v1.8f.
