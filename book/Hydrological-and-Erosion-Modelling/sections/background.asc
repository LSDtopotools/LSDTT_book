=== Origins: relation to CAESAR-Lisflood

The model is essentially a stripped down translation of the CAESAR-Lisflood model, but without the GUI, and it runs on Linux unlike CAESAR-Lisflood, which is Windows only. If you are happy to run on Windows, and would prefer to use a model in GUI-mode then CAESAR-Lisflood is a good choice for this. This branch of the model is designed to be faster and cross platform, scales up to running on a supercomputer if the resources are available to you. One of the drawbacks to the original model is that you need a dedicated Windows box to do your simulations, you can't send them off to a cluster computer-type facility, which typically run unix. (Unless you have a bunch of spare Windows PCs...) 

With this version you can also perform topographic analysis within the same LSDTopoTools environment, switching easily between modelling and topographic analysis.
