=== Running the Model

The model runs from the command line/terminal/console. You specify the model executable name (CatchmentModel.out) followed by the path name to the parameter file and the parameter file itself. The model will print out updates to the terminal window regularly, keeping you updated to the stage it is at and if there are any errors. The DEM of your catchment must be present in the same folder as your parameter file and must be correctly formatted.


DEM preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, you will have to prepare your own DEM as a separate stage in the workflow. (Using whichever GIS tool you like, or preferably our own software!). The DEM should be set up so that one side of the catchment will act as the flow exit point. If you do not have the intended catchment outlet point touching one of the DEM edges, you will get unrealistic pooling of water and flood the entire catchment. *In other words: There should be no 'NODATA' values between the outlet cell(s) and the edge the DEM file.* This is very important for the model to work correctly. 

NOTE: The model will actually route water flow off *all* edges of the catchment. This might be fine for what you need, but discharge timeseries file

Technically, the DEM doesn't need to be pit-filled, but it may be worthwhile to do so as parts of the model can be sped up when the catchment is in a low-flow or steady-flow state. Again, it depends on your intended usage of the model. 

Set up and Parameter File overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sample parameter file is provided for the Boscastle floods simulation. This is a 48-hour simulation using a 5m DEM, over a catchment 3km x 5.5km. It will take about 2-3 hours to run on a mid-range Desktop machine. (You can dramatically speed this up by using a coarser DEM.)

In the Parameter file, you'll notice that you can use comments by starting the line with a hash (\#) sign. Parameters themselves take the form:

[source,console]
----
paramter_name:     VALUE
----

Make sure not to change the parameter_name, otherwise the parser will not recognise the name and not load the value. Instead you will get the default value in the header file. **(Yes, I know this is not the best way of ingesting a parameter file, and leaves a lot of chance to human error - I will come up with a better way...)**

Input files
^^^^^^^^^^^

As a minimum, you need a *DEM input* file, *paramter file*, and *rainfall data* input file.

Once you are happy with the paramter file, you must run the model with two command line arguments:

[source,console]
----
./CatchmentModel.out [PATH TO INPUT FILES] [PARAMETER FILE NAME]
----

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

dem_name
+++++++++
The base name of your dem input file. 

NOTE: This is the topmost 'surface' in the model, i.e. the sediment layer. Bedrock DEM is specificed under the `bedrock_data_file` parameter. 

dem_read_extension
++++++++++++++++++
The file extension of your DEMs (currently has to be same for all DEM supplementary files, sorry)

timeseries_save_interval
++++++++++++++++++++++++
The model generates a timeseries file that contains data on the total basinwide water and sediment discharges. This timestep (in *minutes* of simulated time) determines how often the timeseries data is generated. More on this file later.

Supplementary Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Supplementary files for other features of the model.

hydroindex_file
+++++++++++++++
This file determines the different areas of rainfall input when using spatially variable rainfall input options.

rainfall_data_file
++++++++++++++++++
This should be a text file with some rainfall values (for input into the catchment). For uniform rainfall, the file would contain a value for rainfall in mm/time step on each line. Typically mm/hr is used, but any time step can be set. Make sure to set the `rain_data_time_step` paramter below as well!

grain_data_file
+++++++++++++++
(not yet implemented - it would be used to set the starting distribution of grainsizes)

bedrock_data_file
++++++++++++++++++

Numerical    
^^^^^^^^^

Parameters that control the numerical model time-stepping etc, and the model run time.

min_time_step
+++++++++++++
Leave at 0.

max_time_step
+++++++++++++
Probably leave at 3600 (seconds), i.e. one hour. You could potentially get model speed up if your increased it, and your rainfall data was at larger intervals than hourly.

run_time_start
+++++++++++++++
Leave 0 for now, would be used for restarting runs.

max_run_duration
++++++++++++++++
This is the length of the simulation in hours, MINUS 1. I.e. If you are doing a 48hour simulation, this number should be 47..**(Yes, I know this is daft, and I will get round to fixing it at some point)**

memory_limit
+++++++++++++
(ignore this)

Sediment
^^^^^^^^

transport_law		 
+++++++++++++
Type either **einstein** or **wilcock** to select your favourite sediment transport law.

max_tau_velocity	    
++++++++++++++++

active_layer_thickness
++++++++++++++++++++++

recirculate_proportion
++++++++++++++++++++++

lateral_erosion_on
++++++++++++++++++

lateral_ero_rate
+++++++++++++++++

edge_filter_passes
+++++++++++++++++++

cells_shift_lat
+++++++++++++++

max_diff_cross_chan
+++++++++++++++++++

erode_limit       
+++++++++++

Hydrology
^^^^^^^^^
Parameters for the hydrological part of the model.

TOPMODEL_m_value
++++++++++++++++
As well as the water routing sub-model, LSDCatchmentModel also calculates the discharge based on Beven's TOPMODEL (i.e. discharge approximation based on drainage area and topography. The model contains the infamous **m** parameter, which varies depending on environment. You should consult the literature for appropriate values. Unless you aren't bothered about the TOPMODEL output, in which case leave it at 0.01. 

TIP: For catchment mode this is an important variable as it controls the peak and duration of the hydrograph generated by a rain event. It is the same as the 'm' value in TOPMODEL, that CAESAR-lisfloods hydrological model is based on. Typical values for m are from 0.02 (low - meaning low flood peaks and long duration hydrographs) to 0.005 (higher, flashier peaks) and examples of values used can be found in the CAESAR and TOPMODEL literature. 

rainfall_data_on
++++++++++++++++
Leave set to 'yes' for now.

rain_data_time_step
+++++++++++++++++++
The time step in minutes. This must match the rainfall input data file timestep!

spatial_var_rain
++++++++++++++++
No for uniform rainfall input, yes to use the spatially variable option.

in_out_difference
+++++++++++++++++
Speeds up the model running, during periods of approximate steady state (in terms of water in vs water out of the outlet point). Set to zero to disallow this feature. Otherwise, give the maximum allowed difference in cumecs. 

min_Q_for_depth_calc
++++++++++++++++++++
This is a threshold above which the model will calculate a flow depth. If this is not set, then it wastes time calculating flow depths of fractions of a mm which will not cause any erosion or deposition. This variable dependent upon grid cell size, and as a guide set this parameter to 0.1 per meter cell size For example a DEM with 10m cell size will have a Min Q of 0.1, and a DTM with 50m cell size will have a Min Q of 0.5. 

max_Q_for_depth_calc
++++++++++++++++++++
This can be important for the hydrological model - which will add water for every cell greater than Min Q - but less than the limit set here. In other words, reducing this value will force water to be added more in the headwaters rather than progressively down through the catchment. 

water_depth_erosion_threshold
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The model will only calculate erosion above water depths of this value in *metres*.

slope_on_edge_cell
++++++++++++++++++
The slope for the exit cells on the edges of the model domain. Lisflood-FP requires a slope for these cells in order to calculate a water depth and thus flow out from the model. This is actually quite important in controlling the erosion and deposition that occurs along the far right hand side of the DEM. Set too low and you will get deposition, too high and scour heading back upstream. To set this value, calculate the mean valley floor (near channel) slope for the channel near where it exits. 

evaporation_rate
++++++++++++++++
(ignore for now)

courant_number
++++++++++++++
Courant number' is a value that controls the numerical stability and speed of operation of the flow model. More details can be found in Bates et al (2009). It should only range between 0.2 and 0.7. Higher values increase the model time step but are more unstable. Stability and thus values also depends upon the grid cell size. Larger cells (e.g. 20m, 50m+) can take values of 0.7, smaller cells (e.g. 2m) may need the smallest value (0.2). Stability is also linked to the erodelimit value (sediment tab) which controls the amount of sediment that can be eroded or deposited from a cell. Reccomended values are 0.5 for 50m dem, 0.2 for 10m or less. 

froude_num_limit
++++++++++++++++
If too much flow is allowed between cells per time step, then this can lead to checkerboarding effects - which can also be controlled by lowering the Courant number above. In addition the model can be set to prevent flows exceeding a froude number (specified in this box) passing between cells. The default value is 0.8 resulting in sub-critical flow - it can be set higher if you like and in many circumstances works fine at 1. You may want to use lower values (e.g the default or possibly even lower) if working with deep flows (including lakes) at fine grid cell resolutions.

Of course restricting the flow according to froude number has the knock on effect of reducing the speed of a flood wave moving through a reach - can also cause raised water depths and can reduce erosion rates. 

mannings_n
++++++++++
The Roughness co-efficient used by the water flow model. Look up suitable values here: http://www.fsl.orst.edu/geowater/FX3/help/8_Hydraulic_Reference/Mannings_n_Tables.htm

hflow_threshold
+++++++++++++++
This is a parameter in the Lisflood FP flow model. It relates directly to the hflow parameter in papers describing the Lisflood FP model. hflow is the water surface elevation between two cells. A threshold (this value) is usually used to prevent the flow model from trying to move water when there are very small gradients between cells. A good default value is 0.00001 (the units are in m). 

num_unique_rain_cells
+++++++++++++++++++++
For spatially variable rainfall mode. The number of different areas of rainfall you are using.

Write Output Rasters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

raster_output_interval
