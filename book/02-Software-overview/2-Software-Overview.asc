== Required and useful software

LSDTopoTools is a collection of programs written in pass:[C++] that crunch topographic data.
To run LSDTopoTools all that is really required is a functioning pass:[C++] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler]
(which is a program that translates pass:[C++] code into 1s and 0s that your computer can understand),
the https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[make utility],
and for specific components a few extra libraries. Most analyses will not need libraries.

As a standalone bit of software, LSDTopoTools does not require vast effort in installing the required software.
However, if you want to look at the data produced by the software, or use some of our automation scripts,
you will need to install additional packages on your system.
