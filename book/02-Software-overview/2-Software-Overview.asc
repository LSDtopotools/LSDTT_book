== Required and useful software

IMPORTANT: This chapter describes the software you need for **LSDTopoTools**, but you do not have to install everything yourself. This process is automated by a program called Vagrant. If you just want to get started, you can skip to these instructions: <<Installing LSDTopoTools on a Windows machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>. You can also set up **LSDTopoTools** on Linux and MacOS using the Vagrant approach, see the chapter on Vagrant for details.  

**LSDTopoTools** is a collection of programs written in pass:[C++] that analyze topographic data, and can perform some modelling tasks such as fluvial incision, hillslope evolution and flood innundation. 
To run **LSDTopoTools** all that is really required is a functioning pass:[C++] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler]
(which is a program that translates pass:[C++] code into 1s and 0s that your computer can understand),
the https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[make utility],
and for specific components a few extra libraries. Most analyses will not need libraries.

As a standalone bit of software, **LSDTopoTools** does not require vast effort in installing the required software.
However, if you want to look at the data produced by the software, or use some of our automation scripts,
you will need to install additional packages on your system.

=== Summary

This chapter has given an overview of what software is necessary to use **LSDTopoTools**.
The appendices contain information about installing this software on both
<<Setting up on Windows,Windows>> and <<Setting up on Linux,Linux>> operating systems, but these are only for stubborn people who like to do everything by hand.
