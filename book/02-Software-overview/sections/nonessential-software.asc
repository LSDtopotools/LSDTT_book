=== Nonessential software

There are a number of software packages that are not required to run LSDTopoTools, but that you might find useful.

First, many people use geographic information software (GIS) to visualize data.
If you work at a university or a private company, you might have a license to https://www.arcgis.com/features/[ArcGIS],
a popular commercial GIS.
However, if you are not part of a large institution or your institutional license does not allow home use, it can be convenient to have an open source alternative.
In addition, if you want to edit our documentation or make your own fork for notes,
you might consider using the same tools we do, which require the Ruby programming language.

==== An open source GIS: QGIS

The industry standard GIS is http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis[ArcGIS], and if you are at a university you might have a site license for this software.
It is not so easy to get on a personal computer, however, so there are a number of open source options that can be used as an alternative.

One alternative, and the one that will be used in these tutorials, is http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS].

If you are familiar with ArcMap, you should be able to become proficient at QGIS in a few days. In my experience,
it also has the advantage of being more stable (i.e., it crashes less) than ArcMap.

One thing that is quite nice about QGIS is the number of plugins that are available.

You should download and install QGIS from their website, and click on the `Plugins tab to get some plugins.
the ``OpenLayers`` plugin, which allows you to quickly load
satellite and map information from all sorts of vendors.

==== Documentation using asciidoctor

This book, and various other notes and websites associated with the LSDTopoTools project,
have been built using something called http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[asciidoctor].
Asciidoctor is used to produce cross-linked documents and documentation,
and has been designed to simplify the tool chain that takes one from writing technical documentation to producing a book rather simple.
You can read about its rationale here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/.
The software has worked well for us.

If you want to get asciidoctor working, you will need to get some packages working in https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby].
The instructions can be found in the appendices.
