=== Getting python running

A number of our extensions and visualisation scripts are written in https://www.python.org/[Python]. 
To get these working you need to install various packages in https://www.python.org/[Python].

IMPORTANT: If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] to set up LSDTopoTools in a Virtual Machine, we recommend installing Python using http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda] on your host machine, rather than installing within your Virtual Linux box.  

==== First option: use Miniconda (works on all operating systems)

We have found the best way to install python is http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]. We will use **Python 2.7**, so use the Python 2.7 installer. 

Once you have installed that, you can go into a powershell or terminal window and get the other stuff you need:

[source,consol]
----
$ conda install scipy
$ conda install matplotlib
$ conda install pandas
$ conda install gdal
$ conda install spyder
----

The only difference in Windows is that your prompt in powershell will say `PS>`. 

WARNING: Spyder will not work on our vagrant server, so you need to install this on your host computer.  

To run spyder you just type `spyder` at the command line. 

WARNING: Spyder needs an older version of a package called *PyQt*. If spyder doesn't start correctly, run:

[source,consol]
----
$ conda install pyqt=4.10 -f
----

==== Getting python running on Linux (and this should also work for OSX) not using miniconda

If you don't want to use http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda], it is quite straightforward to install these on a Linux or OSX system:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
----

or

[source,console]
----
$ yum install python2.7
$ yum install python-pip
----

In OSX, you need a package manager such as http://brew.sh/[Homebrew], and you can follow similar steps. 

After that, you need:

. https://www.scipy.org/[Scipy] for numerics. 
. http://www.numpy.org/[Numpy] for numerics.
. http://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib] for visualisation.
. http://pandas.pydata.org/[Pandas] for working with data.
. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[GDAL python tools] for working with geographic data. 
. https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/[Spyder] for having a working environment. This last one is not required but useful if you are used to Matlab. 

You can get all this with a combination of `pip` and `sudo`, `yum` or `homebrew`, depending on your operating system. 

For example, with an [Ubuntu] system, you can use:
[source, console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas
$ sudo apt-get install spyder
----

The http://www.gdal.org/index.html[GDAL] python tools are a bit harder to install; see here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/.
