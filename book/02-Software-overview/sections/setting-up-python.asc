=== Getting python running

A number of our extensions and visualisation scripts are written in https://www.python.org/[Python]. 
To get these working you need to install various packages in https://www.python.org/[Python].

IMPORTANT: If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] to set up LSDTopoTools in a Virtual Machine within Windows, we recommend installing Python using http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda] in your Windows machine, rather than installing within your Virtual Linux box. 

==== Getting python running on Linux (and this should also work for OSX)

It is quite straightforward to install these on a Linux or OSX system:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
----

or

[source,console]
----
$ yum install python2.7
$ yum install python-pip
----

In OSX, you need a package manager such as http://brew.sh/[Homebrew], and you can follow similar steps. 

After that, you need:

. https://www.scipy.org/[Scipy] for numerics. 
. http://www.numpy.org/[Numpy] for numerics.
. http://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib] for visualisation.
. http://pandas.pydata.org/[Pandas] for working with data.
. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[GDAL python tools] for working with geographic data. 
. https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/[Spyder] for having a working environment. This last one is not required but useful if you are used to Matlab. 

You can get all this with a combination of `pip` and `sudo`, `yum` or `homebrew`, depending on your operating system. 

For example, with and [Ubuntu] system, you can use:
[source, console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas
$ sudo apt-get install spyder
----

The http://www.gdal.org/index.html[GDAL] python tools are a bit harder to install; see here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/.

==== Installing python on Windows

In Windows, there are more options. One way to get https://www.python.org/[Python] set up is to use http://python-xy.github.io/[Python(x,y)]. 
The problem with http://python-xy.github.io/[Python(x,y)] is it installs everything that a scientists could ever conceivably use 
(so this includes a vast amount of stuff you will never use) and in addition it is not so easy to update. It does offer update packages but these have dependencies that often lead to a dead-end, so that you have to uninstall and reinstall everything to get back on the update track. 

http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html[Conda] is a simple installation environment that can work on your Windows machine and we find them easier to update than http://python-xy.github.io/[Python(x,y)]. If you want to install everything all at once (much like in Python(x,y), you should go for https://www.continuum.io/downloads[Anaconda]. 

However, we have used http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda] since we don't need every scientific extension to python, and want to save space for all that delicious topographic data (e.g., from http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography]).

==== Using Miniconda to install the relevant python packages in Windows 

If you have a Windows machine, the recommended setup is first follow the instructions for <<Installing LSDTopoTools on a Windows machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant>> and then set up python using http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda]. Miniconda is a package manager that helps install packages and keep them updated. 

You could install python within your linux virtual machine (which we will set up using vagrant), but the clever thing about vagrant is it syncs your linux files to your windows files and vice versa so you can do your data visualisation in Windows without the the linux operating system slowing things down. So we reccomend installing python in windows. To do that:

. Download and install http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda]. 
. Open a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell[powershell window]. 
. Install scipy, pandas, matplotlib, gdal and spyder:
+
[source,console]
----
PS C:\ conda install scipy
PS C:\ conda install matplotlib
PS C:\ conda install pandas
PS C:\ conda install gdal
PS C:\ conda install spyder
----
+
. After each of these you will need to say "yes" to the packages, and then wait a while as things download and install.
+
NOTE: Installing the above packages will install a bunch of dependent packages that you can use as well, such as Sphinx and iPython. 
+
. Congratulations! You should now have everything you need for LSDTopoTools visualisation and automation on you Windows computer!
