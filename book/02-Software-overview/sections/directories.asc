=== Setting up your file system and keeping it clean

WARNING: This chapter was written on a long bus journey following a conference where a particular genre of beverage endemic to Devon and Sommerset was served in abundance. Read at your own risk.

The past decade has seen such an advance in user interfaces that you don't really have to know anything at all about how computers work to use modern computing devices. I am afraid nobody assiciated with this software project is employed to write a slick user interface. In addition, we don't want a slick user interface since sliding and tapping on a touchscreen to get what you want does not enhance repoducable data analysis. So I am very sorry to say that to use this software you will need to know something about computers. 

If you are one of the people who is developing this code you might amuse yourself by reading this sections because it contains snarky comments that might be construed as jokes by some of the deranged people who worte this software. If you are not familiar with Linux or directory structures this is essential reading. 

==== Files and directories

Everything in a computer is organised into files. These are collections of numbers and/or text that contain information and sometimes programs. Hopefully everyone is still with me. These files need to be put somewhere so they are organised into directoreis which can be nested: i.e., a directory can be inside of another directory. Linux users are born knowing thsi stuff but modern mobile phones and fruit-based operating systems are so slick that this basic structure is not apparent to users. Which is why I am writing this chapter on a bus at half nine in the evening.
