=== Using docker for LSDTopoTools

If you have Windows 8 or later, or MacOS, another option for installing LSDTopoTools is https://www.docker.com/[Docker].

IMPORTANT: Docker and Vagrant are *IMCOMPATIBLE* on windows. It uses something called Hyper-V, the built-in virtualisation engine in Windows, which kills VirtualBox. So you will have to choose which one of these to use. 

==== Setting up docker on MacOS

Nobody has tested this I'm afraid, but it should not be much different than the windows. Download and install https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/[docker for Mac] and then have a look at the Windows instructions. 


==== Setting up docker toolbox

You will need this if you don't have windows 10. 

. Download and install [docker toolbox]

. Start a Docker quickstert terminal. This helpfully failed the first time I ran it. You can run "fix this" and it should find your bash script. If not it is probably here: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\bin\bash.exe` where you need to replace you username. 


. You then need to open a command window or powershell and run:
+
[source,console]
----
> docker-machine create box
----
+
. Now you can clone afriels box.Note you need different syntax from afriel's instructions, presumably becuase Docker for windows is different:
+
[source,console]
----
> docker run --rm -it -v /c/LSDTopoTools/:/LSDTopoTools afriel/lsdtopotools
----
+
. This is basically an empty box. Running `install.sh` doesn't work. The syncing doesn't work. So there will need to be more effort involved in figuring this out! Do not try yet!!

==== Setting up docker for Windows



IMPORTANT: You *MUST* have Windows 8 or later for this to work. 

. Download and install https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[docker for windows].
. When we get hold of a windows 10 machine, we will test this out.
