== Preface by Simon M. Mudd

Welcome to the documentation of the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools].
This is, I am sure, obvious, but LSD stands for Land Surface Dynamics.
Our group chose it because, as far as we know, it is a unique acronym and has no other meanings.

The project started around 2010 due to my increasing frustration with my inability to reproduce topographic analyses that I found in papers and saw at conferences.
Some of the papers that had irreproducible analyses were my own!
Like many scientists working with topographic data, I was using a geographic information system (GIS) to prepare figures and analyze topography,
and after a long session of clicking on commercial software to get just that right figure,
I did not have a record of the steps I took to get there. *Mea culpa*.
However, I do not think I am the only person guilty of doing this!
I wanted a way of doing topographic analysis that did not involve a sequence of mouse clicks.

A second motivation came when my PhD student, http://www.bgs.ac.uk/staff/profiles/41289.html[Martin Hurst], finished his PhD and left Edinburgh for warmer pastures in England.
His PhD included several novel analyses that were clearly very useful,
but also built using the python functionality in a certain commercial GIS and not very portable.
I and my other PhD students wanted to run Martin's analyses on other landscapes,
but this proved to be a painful process that required a lot of emails and telephone calls between Martin and our group.

This motivated me to start writing my own software for dealing with topographic data.
This seemed crazy at the time. Why were we trying to reinvent a GIS?
The answer is that the resulting software, https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools],
*IS NOT A GIS*! It is a series of algorithms that are open-source and can be used to analyze topography,
and the programs that run these analyses, which we call driver programs,
are intended to be redistributed such that if you have the same topographic data as was used in the original analysis,
you should be able to reproduce the analysis *exactly*.
Also the code for the analysis is available so that there is no hiding behind cherry-picked figures.

We hope that others outside our group will find our tools useful, and this document will help users get our tools working on their systems.
I do plead for patience: we have yet to involve anyone in the project that has any formal computer science of software engineering training!
But we do hope to distribute beyond the walls of the http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/[School of GeoScience at the University of Edinburgh],
so please contact us for help, questions or suggestions.


== Overview of the book

The purpose of this book is both to get you started using https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools],
and thus the early chapters contain both pre-requisite material and tutorials.
The latter stages of the book are dedicated to using our driver functions (these are programs that are used to perform specific analyses).
This latter part of the book focuses on research applications;
we tend to write a series of driver functions for our publications which aim to each give some new
geophysical, hydrological or ecological insight into the functioning of landscapes.
Thus the latter half of the book is both long an not really structured like a textbook, and will expand as we conduct research.
However, for those simply interested in learning how to get the code working and to perform some "routine" analyses the initial chapters are structured more like a book.

NOTE: By routine I mean something that is accepted by most professionals such as basin extraction or gradient calculations, and is not likely to be controversial.

*Chapter 1* goes into some more detail about the motivation behind the software,
and involves a bit of commentary about open science.
You are probably safe to skip that chapter if you do not like opinions.

*Chapter 2* is a brief overview of the software you will need to get our software working on your computer,
although the details about how to install things is mainly relegated to the appendices.

*Chapter 3* describes the preliminary steps you need to take with your topographic data
in order to get it into our software. If you have read about or taken a course on GIS, this will be vaguely familiar.
It will introduce http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL], which we find to be much better than commercial software for common tasks such as projections,
coordinate transformations and merging of data.

*Chapter 4* explains how to get our software from its various https://github.com/[Github] repositories,
and has some basic details about the structure of the software.

*Chapters 5-6* are the tutorial component of the book, and have been used in courses at the University of Edinburgh.

*The chapters thereafter consist of documentation of our driver functions that have been used for research, many of which feature in published papers.

*Appendix A* gives more detail about required software to get our package running.

*Appendix B* explains how to get LSDTopoTools running on Windows.
It contains a quite a bit of text about why you don't really want to install our software on Windows,
since installation is much more reliable, functional, and easy on Linux. Don't worry if you don't have a Linux computer!
We will explain how to create a "virtual" Linux computer on your Windows computer.
This description of creating a virtual Linux machine should also work for users of OS X.

*Appendix C* explains how to get LSDTopoTools running on Linux.

*Appendix D* has some more details on how the code is structured. If you are obsessive you could go one step further and look at the
http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html[documentation of the source code].

*Appendix E* explains the different options in the analysis driver functions, which allow simple analyses driven by a single program.
