=== Analysing drainage density for basins with CRN-derived erosion rates

This section provides instructions for how to extract the drainage density for basins upstream of a series of point locations, such as cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN)-derived erosion rate samples.  As an example, we will use the erosion rate data collected by Hurst et al. (2012) and Riebe et al. (2000) for the Feather River, Northern California.  The lidar data for this area is available from http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography]. We haven't included it in our example datasets as it is too large, but information on how to convert it into the right format can be found in our section on <<GDAL>>.

==== Formatting your erosion rate data

The program needs to read in a text file with the erosion rate data.  This file needs to be called `DEM_name_cosmo.txt` where `DEM_name` is the name of the DEM *without extension*.  The file should have a row for each sample, with 4 columns, each separated by a space:

. X coordinate - same as DEM coordinate system
. Y coordinate - same as DEM coordinate system
. Erosion rate of the sample
. Error of the sample

An example of the file for the Feather River is shown below (UTM Zone 10N):

[source,paramfile]
----
640504.269	4391321.669	125.9	23.2
647490.779	4388656.033	253.8	66.6
648350.747	4388752.059	133.3	31.9
643053.985	4388961.321	25.2	2.7
643117.485	4389018.471	18.5	2
...
----

This file has to be stored *in the same folder as your DEM*.

==== Creating the paramter file

Along with the text file with the erosion rate data, you must also create a parameter file to run the code with.  This should have the same format as the parameter file for running the analysis on all the basins, minus the last two lines. The format is shown below:

[source,paramfile]
----
Name of the DEM without extension
Name of the channel heads file - will vary depending on your channel extraction method
Minimum slope for filling the DEM
----

This should also be stored in the same folder as your DEM.

==== Step 1: Run the code

Before the code can be run, you must compile it using the makefile in the folder `LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity/driver_functions_DrainageDensity`.  Navigate to the folder using the command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd driver_functions_DrainageDensity/
----

and compile the code with:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f get_drainage_density_cosmo.make
----

This may come up with some warnings, but should create the file `get_drainage_density_cosmo.out`. You can then run the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./get_drainage_density_cosmo.out /path/to/DEM/location/ name_of_parameter_file.driver
----

where `/path/to/DEM/location` is the path to your DEM, and `name_of_parameter_file.driver` is the name of the parameter file you created.

The program will create a text file called `DEM_name_drainage_density_cosmo.txt` which can be ingested by our Python script to plot up the data.  This file has 9 rows with the following data:

. Drainage density of the basin
. Mean basin slope
. Standard deviation of slope
. Standard error of slope
. Basin erosion rate
. Error of the basin erosion rate
. Basin drainage area
. Mean hilltop curvature of the basin
. Standard error of hilltop curavture

It will also create some new rasters:

* DEM_name_slope: slope of the DEM
* DEM_name_curv: curvature of the DEM

==== Step 2: Plot the data

Navigate to the folder `Python_scripts` within the `LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity` repository.  You should find the following files:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projecst/LSDTopoTools_DraiangeDensity/Python_scripts$ ls
drainage_density_plot.py	drainage_density_plot_cosmo.py
----

Open the file called `drainage_density_plot_cosmo.py`.  We suggest doing this on your host machine rather than the virtual machine: for instructions about how to install Python on your host machine please see the section on <<Getting python running>>.  

Open the Python script in your favourite text editor.  At the bottom of the file you need to change the DataDirectory (Line 131) and the DEM identifier (Line 133) to reflect your data:

[source,python]
----
# change this to the path to your DEM
DataDirectory = 'C:\\vagrantboxes\\LSDTopoTools\\Topographic_projects\\Feather_River\\'
# Name of the DEM WITHOUT FILE EXTENSION
DEM_name = 'fr1m_nogaps'
make_plots(DataDirectory, DEM_name)   
----

You should end up with a plot like the one below:

.Plot of drainage density against erosion rate for basins with CRN samples for Feather River, California
image::images/fr1m_nogaps_drainage_density_cosmo.png[Plot of drainage density against erosion rate, 600,400]

==== Summary

You should now be able to extract the drainage density for a series of different basins across the landscape.  These can either be all basins of a specific order (Step 1), or basins defined by point coordinates (e.g. for catchment-averaged erosion rates from CRN samples in Step 2).
