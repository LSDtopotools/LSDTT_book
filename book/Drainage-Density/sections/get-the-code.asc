=== Get the code for drainage density analysis

The code for the drainage density analysis can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for extracting the drainage density for a series of basins defined by points from cosmogenic radionuclide samples, as well as the drainage density and mean hilltop curvature for basins of a specified order.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  If you have downloaded LSDTopoTools using vagrant, then this should be in the folder `Git_projects`.  Please refer to the chapter on <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant>> for more information on this.  To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/$ cd /LSDTopoTools
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/$ cd /Git_projects
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity.git
----
Navigate to this folder again using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity/
----

==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity/archive/master.zip
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the drainage density analysis. In this tutorial we will work using a LiDAR dataset from the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico.  This is a clip of the original dataset, which we have resampled to 2 m resolution. The full dataset is available from http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography.]. If you are using the vagrant distribution, create a new folder within the `Topographic_projects` folder, and then navigate to this folder:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects$ mkdir Guadalupe_NM
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects$ cd Guadalupe_NM/
----

You can get the clip from our ExampleTopoDatasets repository using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Guadalupe_DEM.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Guadalupe_DEM.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the Guadalupe Mountains DEM which will be used in these examples.

==== Get the example parameter files

We have also provided some examples parameter files that are used to run the drainage density analysis.  These should be placed in the same folder as your DEM (e.g. in the folder `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Guadalupe_NM/`. You can get the example parameter file using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/tree/master/example_parameter_files/drainage_density_guadalupe.driver
----

==== Python scripts

We have also provided some Python scripts for creating figures from the draiange density analysis.  These should produce similar figures to those in Clubb et al. (2016), JGR-ES.  These scripts are in the directory `Python_scripts` within `LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity`:

[source,console]
----
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity$ cd Python_scripts
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-precise-32:/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity/Python_scripts$ ls 
drainage_density_plot.py	drainage_density_plot_cosmo.py
