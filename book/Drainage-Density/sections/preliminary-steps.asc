=== Preliminary steps

==== Getting the channel head file

Before the drainage density analysis can be run, you must create a channel network for your DEM.  This can be done using the <<Channel extraction>> algorithms within LSDTopoTools.  There are several channel extraction algorithms which you can choose from: for more details please refer to the <<Channel extraction>> section.  Once you have run the channel extraction algorithm, you must make sure that the `bil` and `hdr` files with the channel head locations are placed in the same folder as the DEM you intend to use for the drainage density analysis. 

==== Selecting a window size

Before we can run the drainage density algorithm, we need to calculate the correct window size for calculating mean hilltop curvature across the DEM.  Please refer to the <<Selecting A Window Size>> section for information on how to calculate a window size for your DEM.
