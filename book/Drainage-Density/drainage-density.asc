== Calculating drainage density 

Drainage density is a fundamental landscape metric which describes the total length of channels in a basin normalised by the basin area, first described by Horton (1945).  In this chapter we describe how to calculate the drainage density and mean hilltop curvature of a specified order of drainage basins (for example, all second order basins). We also include code which will calculate the drainage density of each basin given a list of cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN)-derived erosion rate data. We used this code to examine the relationship between drainage density and erosion rate in our paper published in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JF003747/full[JGR Earth Surface] in 2016.

.Quick guide if you already know what you are doing
*****************************************************************************

Here is a quick overview of how to set up and run the code, if you have done it before:

. Choose the channel extraction method that you would like to use.
. Make sure your DEM is in `bil` format and is in the Topographic_projects folder
. Create a parameter file for your DEM
. Make sure you have created a channel network for your DEM, and have the `_CH` file in your repository.
. Compile step 1 of the code using `make -f drainage_density_step1_junctions.make`
. Run step 1 of the program with `./drainage_density_step1_junctions.out /path_to_data_folder/ parameter_file.driver`
. Compile step 2 of the code using `make -f drainage_density_step2_basins.make`
. Run step 2 of the code using `./drainage_density_step2_basins.out /path_to_data_folder/ parameter_file.driver`
. Run the Python scripts to plot the data.
