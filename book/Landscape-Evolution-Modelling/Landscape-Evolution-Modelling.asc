Landscape Evolution Modelling with LSDTopoTools
-----------------------------------------------

The LSD Topo Toolbox contains a landscape evolution model. The model implementation is contained in the LSDRasterModel files. The driver file is `model_driver.cpp`. The landscape model is partly based on the FastScape algorithm http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X12004618[(Braun 2013)], an efficient method for solving the stream power law for fluvial incision, as well as the MUDDPile algorithms for hillslope evolution. It contains both hillslope and fluvial components, which can be run individually, simulating a single hillside for example, or together, to simulate whole landscape evolution. The model will run from default parameters if none are supplied, but the user can also specify their own choice of parameters for the model run, which are detailed below.

Model Parameters and Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Model Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.Run Name
This is the name that will be appened to all output files generated during the model run. The model will check to see if this name has already been used before overwriting existing output files.

.NRows
This is the number of rows in the model domain. You can also think of it as the _y_ dimension of the model grid.

.NCols
This is the number of columns in the model domain. You can also think of it as thee _x_ dimension of the model grid.

.Resolution
The resolution of the model grid. The size in metres that a single grid cell represents.

Boundary code
This code determines the output sides of the model grid. I.e. which sides are for sediment output and which are not. The _b_ represents base level, _n_ represents no flow, and _p_ represents periodic boundary conditions.

.Time step
The model timestep, _dt_

.End time
The end time for the model run

.End time mode
This sets the model to either run until it reaches steady state (=1), or until a specified time (=0).

.Uplift mode
Instructs the model to use block, uniform uplift, or an uplift field.

.Max uplift
The uplift rate (m/yr)

.Tolerance
This parameter sets the iteration tolerance value in the LSDRasterModel object. The value is related to the implicit solver and when the solution is considered to be 'converged upon' and the numerical soultion solved. (DAV - needs more explanation?)

.Print interval
The output file interval.

Fluvial Component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.Fluvial
Turns the fluvial component *on* or *off*, with these respective keywords.

.K
The _K_ paramter used in the many forms of the stream power equation and its derivatives. _K_ can also be thought of as the erodibility. Typical values for K are something like 0.0001 to 0.002, but these can vary significantly between different lithologies/environments etc. The default is 0.0002. 

.m
The _m_ exponent of the stream power law. Typical values of the m/n ratio are between 0.3 and 0.7, but consult the literature if it is availble for your study area. The ratio is related to the concavity of the idealised river profile. The default value of _m_ is 0.5. 

.n
The _n_ exponent of the stream power law. Typical values are around 1.0. (Which is the default value). The above parameters are related to each other in the stream power equation as below:

latexmath:[I = KA^mS^n]

where _I_ is the incision rate, _A_ is the drainage area, and _S_ is the slope of the channel. The fluvial component of the model is based on this equation, which is a good approximation in many bedrock mountainous landscapes, though your mileage may vary.

.K mode
Sets the K value to be constant (0 is default, meaning constant).


Hillslope Component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The hillslope component comes in two flavours, a linear model and a non-linear one. 

.Hillslope
Turns the hillslope component *on* or *off*

.Non-linear
Sets the hillslope law to linear or non-linear. (*on* or *off*)

.D
The soil transport coefficient. The _D_ value is used in calculating the soil creep functions in the model.

.S_c
The critical slope angle. The default is 30 degrees.

Running the Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once compiled, the model is run using:
[source,console]
----
./model.out [parameter.file] [run_name]
----

Screen output should help the user see if the components/parameters have run as expected.
