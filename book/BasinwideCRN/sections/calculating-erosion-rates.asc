=== Calculating erosion rates

Okay, now you are ready to get the erosion rates.
You'll need to run the function from the directory where the compiled code is located
(in our example, `/home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide/`), but it can work on data in some arbitrary location.

==== Compiling the code

To compile the code, go to the driver function folder
(in the example, `/home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide/driver_functions_CRNBasinwide`)
and type:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f Basinwide_CRN.make
----

This will result in a program called *Basinwide_CRN.exe*.

==== Running the basinwide erosion rate calculator

[source,console]
----
$ ./Basinwide_CRN.exe pathname_of_data file_prefix method_flag
----

* The pathname_of_data is just the path to where your data is stored, in this example that is
`/home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino/`.
+
IMPORTANT: You *MUST* remember to put a ``/`` at the end of your pathname.
+
* The filename is the **PREFIX** of the files you need for the analysis (that is, without the extension).
In the example this prefix is `SanBern` (or `SanBern_Spawned` if you spawned separate shielding basins)
+
* The `method_flag` tells the program what method you want to use to calculate erosion rates. The options are:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
.Method flag options
|===
|Flag
|Description

|0
|A basic analysis that does not include any shielding (i.e., no topographic, snow or self shielding).

|1
|An analysis that includes shielding, but does not account for spawning (see <<Spawning the basins>> for details on spawning).
**If this option is used on spawned basins it is likely to result in errors**. 

|2
|An analyis that includes shielding, to be used on spawned basins (see <<Spawning the basins>> for details on spawning). This is the default.

|===



==== The output files

There are two output files. Both of these files will end up in the `pathname` that you designated when calling the program.

The first is called `file_prefix_CRNResults.csv` and the second is called `file_prefix_CRONUSInput.txt`
where file_prefix is the prefix you gave when you called the program.

So, for example, if you called the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./basinwide_CRN.exe /home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino/ SanBern
----

The outfiles will be called:

[source,console]
----
SanBern_CRNResults.csv
SanBern_CRONUSInput.txt
----

The `_CRONUSInput.txt` is formatted to be cut and pasted directly into the CRONUS calculator.
The file has some notes (which are pasted into the top of the file):

.Header of the *_CRONUSInput.txt file
[source,paramfile]
----
->IMPORTANT nuclide concentrations are not original!
      They are scaled to the 07KNSTD!!
->Scaling is averaged over the basin for snow, self and topographic shielding.
->Snow and self shielding are considered by neutron spallation only.
->Pressure is an effective pressure that reproduces Stone scaled production
      that is calculated on a pixel by pixel basis.
->Self shielding is embedded in the shielding calculation and so
      sample thickness is set to 0.
----

IMPORTANT: You should only paste the contents of the file below the header into the CRONUS calculator, which can be found here: 
http://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/al_be_v22/al_be_erosion_multiple_v22.php
A new version of the CRONUS caluclator should be available late 2015 but should be backward compatible with the prior version. See here:
http://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/index_dev.html


The `_CRNResults.csv` is rather long.
It contains the following data in comma separated columns:

[cols="1,1,1,8", options="header"]
.Columns in the `_CRNResults.csv` file
|===
|Column
|Name
|Units
|Description

|1
|basinID
|Integer
|A unique identifier for each CRN sample.

|2
|sample_name
|string
|The name of the sample

|3
|Nuclide
|string
|The name of the nuclide. Must be either `10Be` or `26Al`

|4
|latitude
|decimal degrees
|The latitude. 

|5
|longitude
|decimal degrees
|The longitude. 

|6      
|concentration
|atoms/g
|The concentration of the nuclide. This is adjusted for the recent standard (e.g., 07KNSTD),
so it may not be the same as in the original dataset. 

|7      
|concentration_uncert
|atoms/g
|The concentration uncertainty of the nuclide.
Most authors report this as only the AMS uncertainty.
The concentration is adjusted for the recent standard (e.g., 07KNSTD),
so it may not be the same as in the original dataset. 
 
|8
|erosion rate
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate in mass per unit area: this is from the full spatially distributed 
erosion rate calculator. 

|9
|erosion rate AMS_uncert 
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area: this is from the full spatially distributed 
erosion rate calculator. The uncertainty is only that derived from AMS uncertainty. 
  
|10
|muon_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area derived from muon uncertainty.
 
|11
|production_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area derived from uncertainty in the production rate. 
 
|12
|total_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area that combines all uncertainties.

|AvgProdScaling
|float (dimensionless)
|The average production scaling correction for the basin.

|17
|AverageShielding
|float (dimensionless)
|The average of combined shielding. Used to emulate basinwide erosion for CRONUS. CRONUS takes separate topographic, snow and self shielding values, but our code calculates these using a fully depth integrated approach so to convert our shielding numbers for use in CRONUS we lump these together to be input as a single shielding value in CRONUS. 

|18
|AvgShield_times_AvgProd
|float (dimensionless)
|The average of combined shielding times production. This is for use in emulating the way CRONUS assimilates data, since it CRONUS calculates shielding and production separately. 

|19
|AverageCombinedScaling
|float (dimensionless)
|The average combined shielding and scaling correction for the basin. 

|20
|outlet_latitude

|The pressure of the basin outlet (calculated based on NCEP2 data after CRONUS).

|22
|OutletEffPressure
|hPa
|The pressure of the basin outlet (calculated based on NCEP2 data after CRONUS) needed to get the production scaling at the outlet. 

|23
|centroid_latitude
|decimal degrees
|The latitude of the basin centroid. This can be assumed to be in http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[WGS84 geographic coordinate system].

|24
|centroidPressure
|hPa
|The pressure of the basin centroid (calculated based on NCEP2 data after CRONUS).

|25
|CentroidEffPressure

|This is the pressure needed to get basin averaged production scaling: 
it is a means of translating the spatially distributed production data into a single value for the CRONUS calculator. 

|26
|eff_erate_COSMOCALC
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate you would get if you took production weighted scaling and used
cosmocalc. 

|27
|erate_COSMOCALC_mmperkyr_rho2650

cosmocalc. Assumes stem:[/rho] = 2650 kg m^-3^.

|28
|eff_erate_COSMOCALC_emulating_CRONUS
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^

|31
|erate_totalerror_mmperkyr_rho2650
|mm kyr^-1^
|Uncertainty in the erosion rate using the full calculator. Assumes stem:[/rho] = 2650 kg m^-3^.

|32
|basin_relief
|m
|The relief of the basin. Because production scales nonlinearly with elevation, 
it is likeley that errors in erosion rates arising from not calculating production on a pixel-by-pixel basis will correlate with relief. 
In addition, higher relief areas will have greater topographic shielding, 
so prior reported results that used either no topographic shielding or low resoltion topographic shielding are likeley to have greater errors.

===== Reducing the output data

Users may wish to reduce the data contained within `_CRNResults.csv` file, so we provide python scripts for doing so.
