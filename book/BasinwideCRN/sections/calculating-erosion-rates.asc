=== Calculating erosion rates

Okay, now you are ready to get the erosion rates.
You'll need to run the function from the directory where the compiled code is located
(in our example, `/home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide/`), but it can work on data in some arbitrary location.

==== Compiling the code

To compile the code, go to the driver function folder
(in the example, `/home/LSDTT_repositories/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide/driver_functions_CRNBasinwide`)
and type:

[source,console]
----
$ ./Basinwide_CRN.exe pathname_of_data file_prefix
----

* The pathname_of_data is just the path to where your data is stored, in this example that is
`/home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino/`.
+
IMPORTANT: You *MUST* remember to put a ``/`` at the end of your pathname.
+
* The filename is the **PREFIX** of the files you need for the analysis (that is, without the extension).
In the example this prefix is `SanBern` (or `SanBern_Spawned` if you spawned separate shielding basins)

==== The output files

There are two output files. Both of these files will end up in the `pathname` that you designated when calling the program.

The first is called `file_prefix_CRNResults.csv` and the second is called `file_prefix_CRONUSInput.txt`
where file_prefix is the prefix you gave when you called the program.

So, for example, if you called the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./basinwide_CRN.exe /home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino/ SanBern
----

The outfiles will be called:

[source,console]
----
SanBern_CRNResults.csv
SanBern_CRONUSInput.txt
----

The `_CRONUSInput.txt` is formatted to be cut and pasted directly into the CRONUS calculator.
The file has some notes (which are pasted into the top of the file):

.Header of the *_CRONUSInput.txt file
[source,paramfile]
----
->IMPORTANT nuclide concentrations are not original!
      They are scaled to the 07KNSTD!!
->Scaling is averaged over the basin for snow, self and topographic shielding.
->Snow and self shielding are considered by neutron spallation only.
->Pressure is an effective pressure that reproduces Stone scaled production
      that is calculated on a pixel by pixel basis.
->Self shielding is embedded in the shielding calculation and so
      sample thickness is set to 0.

The `_CRNResults.csv` is rather long.
It contains the following data in comma separated columns:

[cols="1,1,1,8", options="header"]
.Columns in the `_CRNResults.csv` file

|6      
|concentration
|atoms/g
|The concentration of the nuclide. This is adjusted for the recent standard (e.g., 07KNSTD),
so it may not be the same as in the original dataset. 

|7      
|concentration_uncert
|atoms/g
|The concentration uncertainty of the nuclide.
Most authors report this as only the AMS uncertainty.
The concentration is adjusted for the recent standard (e.g., 07KNSTD),
so it may not be the same as in the original dataset. 
 
|8
|erosion rate
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate in mass per unit area: this is from the full spatially distributed 
erosion rate calculator. 

|9
|erosion rate AMS_uncert 
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area: this is from the full spatially distributed 
erosion rate calculator. The uncertainty is only that derived from AMS uncertainty. 
  
|10
|muon_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area derived from muon uncertainty.
 
|11
|production_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area derived from uncertainty in the production rate. 
 
|12
|total_uncert
|g cm^-2^ yr^-1^
|The erosion rate uncertainty in mass per unit area that combines all uncertainties.  
 
|13
|AvgProdScaling

|18
|outlet_latitude
|decimal degrees
|The latitude of the basin outlet.

|centroidPressure
|hPa
|The pressure of the basin centroid (calculated based on NCEP2 data after CRONUS).

|22
|CentroidEffPressure
|hPa
|This is the pressure needed to get basin averaged production scaling: 
it is a means of translating the spatially distributed production data into a single value for the CRONUS calculator.
