=== Snow shielding calculations

Snow absorbs cosmic rays and so CRN concentrations in sediments can be affected 
by snow that has been present in the basin during the period that eroded materials were exposed to cosmic rays. 

Estimating snow shielding is notoriously difficult 
(how is one to rigorously determine the thickness of snow averaged over the last few thousand years?),
and our software does not prescribe a method for calculating snow shielding. 

Rather, our tools allow the user to set snow shielding in 3 ways:

. Use a previously reported basinwide average snow shielding factor
. Assign a single effective average depth of snow over a catchment (in g cm^-2^).
. Pass a raster of effective average depth of snow over a catchment (in g cm^-2^).

==== Using previously reported snow shielding

Some authors report a snow shielding factor in their publications. 
The underlying information about snow and ice thickness used to generate the snow shielding factor is usually missing. 
Because under typical circumstances the spatial distribution of snow thicknesses is not reported, we use reported snow shielding factors
to calculate an effective snow thickness across the basin. 

This approach is only compatible with our spawning method (see the section on <<Spawning the basins>>), 
because this average snow thickness will only apply to the raster containing an individual sample's basin. 

The effective snow thickness is calculated by:

.Converting snow shielding to an effective depth
[latexmath]
++++
d_{eff} = -\Gamma_0*\ln(S_s)
++++

where stem:[d_{eff}] is the effective depth (g cm^-2^), stem:[\Gamma_0] is the attenuation mass (= 160 g cm^-2^) for spallation (we do not consider the blocking of muons by snow), and, stem:[S_s] is the reported snow shielding. 

The reported snow shielding values should be inserted as the 8th column in the `CRNData.csv` file.

For example,

===== Steps to use reported snow shielding

Reported snow shielding values are done on a basin-by-basin basis, so our snow shielding must have individual shielding calculations for each sample. 
This is only possible using our "spawning" routines. 

. The spawning of basins must be performed: see <<Spawning the basins>>
. The `*_spawned_CRNData.csv` should have snow shielding values in the 8th column. 
. A python script, `JoinSnowShielding.py`, must be run that translates reported snow shielding values into effective depths. 
This script, and a required helper script, `LSDOSystemTools.py`  can be downloaded from:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/raw/master/JoinSnowShielding.py
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/raw/master/LSDOSystemTools.py
----
+
You will need to scroll to the bottom of the `JoinSnowShielding.py` program and edit both the path name and the file prefix. 
For example, if your spawned data was in `/home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino/` and the files were `SanBern_spawned_CRNRasters.csv`, `SanBern_spawned_CRNData.csv`, and `SanBern_spawned.CRNParam`, then the bottom of the python file should contain:
+
[source,python]
----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    path = "/home/ExampleDatasets/SanBernardino"
    prefix = "SanBern_spawned"
    GetSnowShieldingFromRaster(path,prefix)  
----
+
. This script will then modify the `*spawned_CRNRasters.csv` so that the second column will have an effective snow shiedling reflecting the reported snow shielding value 
(converted using the equation earlier in this section). It will print a new file, `*spawned_SS_CRNRasters.csv` and copy the CRNData and CRNParam files to ones with prefixes:
`*_spawned_SS_CRNData.csv` and `*_spawned_SS.CRNParam`.
+
. These new files (with `_SS` in the prefix) will then be used by the erosion rate calculator. 

==== Assign a single effective average depth

This option assumes that there is a uniform layer of time-averaged snow thickness over the entire basin. 
The thickness reported is in effective depth (g cm^-2^). 

To assign a constant thickness, one simply must set the section column of `*_CRNRasters.csv` file to the appropriate effective depth.

For example, a file might look like:

.An example CRNRasters.csv file with constant snow shielding
[source,paramfile]
----
/home/topodata/SanBern,15
/home/topodata/Sierra,15,0
/home/topodata/Ganga,15,0,/home/topodata/Ganga_shielded
----

In the above example the first row just sets a constant effective depth of 15  g cm^-2^, 
The second also assigns a self shielding value of 0 g cm^-2^ (which happens to be the default), 
and the third row additionally identifies a topographic shielding raster. 

In general, assigning a constant snow thickness over the entire DEM is not particularly realistic, 
and it is mainly used to approximate the snow shielding reported by other authors when they have not made the spatially distributed data about snow thicknesses available
see <<Using previously reported snow shielding>>.  

==== Pass a raster of effective average depth of snow over a catchment

Our software also allows users to pass a raster of effective snow thicknesses (g cm^-2^). 
This is the time-averaged effective thickness of snow which can be spatially heterogeneous.

The raster is given in the second column of the `*_CRNRasters.csv`, so, for example in the below file the 4th and 6th rows point to snow shielding rasters. 

.An example CRNRasters.csv file
[source,paramfile]
----
/home//basin_data/Site01/Site01_DEM,0,0,/home/basin_data/Site01/Site01_DEM_TopoShield
/home/basin_data/Site02/Site02_DEM,5,10
/home/basin_data/Site03/Site03_DEM,5,/home/basin_data/Site03/Site03_DEM_SelfShield
/home/basin_data/Site04/Site04_DEM,/home/basin_data/Site04/Site04_DEM_SnowShield,/home/basin_data/Site04/Site04_DEM_SelfShield
/home/basin_data/Site05/Site05_DEM
/home/basin_data/Site06/Site06_DEM,/home/basin_data/Site06/Site06_DEM_SnowShield
----

IMPORTANT: The snow shielding raster must be the same size and shape as the underlying DEM 
(i.e. they must have the same number of rows and columns, same coordinate system and same data resolution).

IMPORTANT: These rasters need to be assigned *BEFORE* spawning since the spawning process will clip the snow rasters to be the same size as the clipped topography for each basin. 

==== Compute snow shielding from snow water equivalent data

In some cases you might have to generate the snow shielding raster yourself. We have prepared some python scripts and some pass:[C++] programs that allow you to do this.

1. First, you need to gather some data. You can get the data from http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/snotel-wedata.html[snow observations], or from https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0271[reconstructions]. The simple functions we have prepared simply approximate snow thickness as a function of elevation. 
+
2. You need to take your study area, and prepare a file that has two columns, seperated by a space. 
The first column is the elevation in metres, and the second column is the average annual snow water equivalent in mm. 
+
3. Once you have this file, download the following python script from our repository:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide/raw/master/SnowShieldFit.py
----
+
4. Open the python file and change the filename to reflect the name of your data file, then run the script with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python SnowShieldFit.py
----
+
5. This will produce a file with the extension sparam.
