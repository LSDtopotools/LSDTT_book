== Basinwide cosmogenic analysis

The LSDCosmoBasin toolkit is designed to automate calculation of basinwide erosion rates determined estimated from the concentration of in situ cosmogenic nuclides.
Currently ^10^Be and ^26^Al are supported.

The toolkit requires:

  * Data on cosmogenic samples.
  * A file containing filenames of the topographic data, and optional filenames for shielding rasters.
  * A parameter file.

The toolkit then produces
  * A csv file that contains results of the analysis.
  * A text file that can be copied into the http://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/al_be_v22/al_be_erosion_multiple_v22.php>[CRONUS online calculator] for data comparison.

=== Summary

You should now be able take date from basinwide cosmogenics and convert these into erosion rates.
