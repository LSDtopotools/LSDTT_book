== DEM preprocessing Options

The *DEM preprocessing* program is distributed with the *AnalysisDriver* and can be found here:
https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver.

Like the analysis driver, the DEM proprocessing program runs from parameter files.
In this appendix we document the options for running the DEM preprocessing program from a parameter file.

=== AnalysisDriver file input and output options

.File input and output options
|===
|Keyword
|Input type
|Description

|dem read extension
|string
|The type of data format used in reading rasters. Options are `bil`, `asc` and `flt`.

|dem write extension
|string
|The type of data format used in reading rasters. Options are `bil`, `asc` and `flt`.

|write path
|string
|The path to which data is written.

|read path
|string
|The path from which data is read.

|write fname
|string
|The prefix of rasters to be written *without extension*.
For example if this is `Test` and you have selected `bil` format then a fill operation will result in a file called `Test_Fill.bil`.

|read fname
|string
|The filename of the raster to be read without extension. For example if the raster is `MyRaster.bil`, read fname will be `MyRaster`.

=== DEM preprocessing routines to run

IMPORTANT: These require booleans,
but in the parameter file booleans must be *true*--anything else is considered false.
`true` is case sensitive, so *DO NOT* write `True`: it will be interpreted as false!!

|Keyword
|Input type
|default
|Description

|fill_nodata
|boolean
|false
|Fills holes of nodata in a DEM

|remove_low_relief
|boolean
|false
|Finds low relief areas (defined by parameters below) and sets to nodata.

|write_relief_raster
|boolean
|false
|Writes a relief raster.

=== Parameters for removing high and low values (including weird nodata)

[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]

|Keyword
|Input type
|default
|Description

|minimum_elevation
|float
|0
|The minimum elevation of the DEM. Anything below this is set to nodata.

|maximum_elevation
|float
|30000
|The maximum elevation of the DEM. Anything above this is set to nodata. It is set to 30000 to account for yanks, who bizarrely insist on using idiotic Imperial units, even though everyone else in the world realised decades ago that they are crap.

=== Parameters for masking parts of the DEM

|Keyword
|Input type
|default
|Description

|filling_window_radius
|float
|50
|Radius of the window that is used to search for nodata islands. If there is a non nodata point withing this radius of a nodata point it is filled. 

|relief_radius
|float
|100
|Radius of the window over which relief is calculated. 

|relief_threshold
|float
|20
|Any relief less than this will be turned to nodata.
