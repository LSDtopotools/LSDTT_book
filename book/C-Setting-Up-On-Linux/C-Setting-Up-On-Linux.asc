== Setting up on Linux

Setting up your system on Linux is considerably easier than setting up on Windows.
Before doing anything, open a terminal window. The `$` symbol below indicates commands typed into the terminal window.

WARNING: These commands are for *Ubuntu* and *Debian* flavors of Linux. Other flavors of Linux use different package managers, such as http://yum.baseurl.org/[yum].
If you don't use Debian of Ubuntu, you will need to look up the installation guidelines for the programs below.

=== Git

To check if git is working, type

  $ git --version

If it isn't installed, install it with

  $ sudo apt-get install git

=== Python

To check if it is working, just type

  $ python

If it is working, it will tell you the version and you will get a command prompt that looks like this:

   >>>

You should have version 2.7 or above.

==== Installing python

If you don't have python, you should install both *python* and *pip*, which manages python packages.
To do that type:

  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

==== Installing python packages

To check if python packages are there, just try to import them. First start a python session:

  $ python

Then, try to import a package. For example:

  >>> import matplotlib

If the package does not exist, you will get an error message like this:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module named matplotlib

You can install all the packages at once with:

  $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

You can upgrade packages with the pip command:

  $ pip install PackageNameHere --upgrade

=== R

You can check if R is working from the terminal window with:

  $ R

If it isn't there, you can install it with

  $ sudo apt-get install r-base-core


=== Ruby

As mentioned in the main section of the book, the ruby programming language is used to build the documentation of our software. You can skip this part if you are viewing the documentation from the pdf or webpages and aren't planning on contributing to the documentation. (Though you if you are contributing new features to the software you are encouraged to!)

You can see if Ruby is on your system by typing:

  $ ruby -v

If it isn't there, install with (this should seem routine by now):

  $ sudo apt-get  install ruby-full

If you already have ruby installed, you might need to check you have the development packages too, along with rubygems, which is a package installer for ruby libraries and add-ons (similar to pip for Python):

  $ sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
  $ sudo apt-get install rubygems

==== Installing the asciidoctor documentation software

After you have installed ruby, ruby-devel, and rubygems you can now proceed to getting the actual ruby packages that make the documentation:

  $ sudo gem install asciidoctor
  $ sudo gem install bundler

If bundler fails to install, you may be missing the ttfunk package.:

  $ sudo gem install ttfunk

Thankfully, the gem installer is quite helpful at telling you which packages are missing and how to quickly install them. That's it now, you can proceed to cloning the documentation from github.

=== Cloning or forking the documentation

The documentation is under version control on github, just like the actual software source code. If you're a developer, you can clone it direct from the original repository, otherwise you will need to fork it first into your own repo, and then clone from there to your local machine. You do this by visiting http://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book and clicking 'fork' (assuming you have a github account of course). Then, on your local machine, you can do:

  $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LSDTT_book.git

and the documentation will be cloned into a directory called LSDTT_book from where you ran the command.

cd into the LSDTT_book directory, and run bundler install:

  $ bundler install

Then, to build the documentation in full from the source files, run:

  $ bundler exec rake book:build

In a few seconds bundler will have completed and you will have a smart looking copy of the documentation in both pdf and html form. Any time you make changes to the documentation source files, run the bundler exec command again to update your local copy. Remember to commit and push your changes regularly to the remote repository on your githb account.

=== c++ and fortran

You can check if these are working by typing (this assumes you are using the https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU compilers])

  $ g++
  $ gfortran

You can install these with

  $ sudo apt-get install g++
  $ sudo apt-get install gfortran

These seem to install `gdb` and `make`, which is convenient.

=== Summary

Well, you have probably spent some time installing all of these software packages so relax for a bit and enjoy the beverage of your choice!
