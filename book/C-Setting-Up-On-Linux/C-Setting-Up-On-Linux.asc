== Setting up on Linux

Setting up your system on Linux is considerably easier than setting up on Windows.
Before doing anything, open a terminal window. The `$` symbol below indicates commands typed into the terminal window.

WARNING: These commands are for *Ubuntu* and *Debian* flavors of Linux. Other flavors of Linux use different package managers, such as http://yum.baseurl.org/[yum].
If you don't use Debian of Ubuntu, you will need to look up the installation guidelines for the programs below.

=== Git

To check if git is working, type

  $ git --version

If it isn't installed, install it with

  $ sudo apt-get install git

=== Python

To check if it is working, just type

  $ python

If it is working, it will tell you the version and you will get a command prompt that looks like this:

   >>>

You should have version 2.7 or above.

==== Installing python

If you don't have python, you should install both *python* and *pip*, which manages python packages.
To do that type:

  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

==== Installing python packages

To check if python packages are there, just try to import them. First start a python session:

  $ python

Then, try to import a package. For example:

  >>> import matplotlib

If the package does not exist, you will get an error message like this:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module named matplotlib

You can install all the packages at once with:

  $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

You can upgrade packages with the pip command:

  $ pip install PackageNameHere --upgrade

=== R

You can check if R is working from the terminal window with:

  $ R

If it isn't there, you can install it with

  $ sudo apt-get install R


=== Ruby

You can see if Ruby is ony your system by typing:

  $ ruby -v

If it isn't there, install with (this should seem routine by now):

  $ sudo apt-get  install ruby-full

=== c++ and fortran

You can check if these are working by typing (this assumes you are using the https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU compilers])

  $ g++
  $ gfortran

You can install these with

  $ sudo apt-get install g++
  $ sudo apt-get install gfortran

These seem to install `gdb` and `make`, which is convenient.

=== Summary

Well, you have probably spent some time installing all of these software packages so relax for a bit and enjoy the beverage of your choice!
