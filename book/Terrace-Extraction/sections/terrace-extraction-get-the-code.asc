=== Get the code for terrace extraction

The code for terrace extraction can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for identifying terraces along a channel swath profile.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  If you installed LSDTopoTools using the vagrant distribution, then this should be the `Git_projects` folder. To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_TerraceExtraction.git
----
==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_TerraceExtraction/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Get the example datasets

We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the terrace extraction algorithm.  If you are using the vagrant distribution, we recommend that you create a new directory in the `Topographic_projects` directory for each field site that you analyse.  Navigate to the `Topographic_projects` directory using the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ cd ..
$ cd Topographic_projects/
----

In this tutorial we will work using a LiDAR dataset from the South Fork Eel River, California.  You should make a new directory for the Eel River DEM in the `Topographic_projects` directory:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir Eel_River/
$ cd Eel_River/
----

You can get the DEM for the South Fork Eel River from our ExampleTopoDatasets repository using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Eel_River_DEM.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Eel_River_DEM.hdr
----

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the South Fork Eel River DEM which will be used in these examples.

==== Get the example parameter files

We have also provided some examples parameter files that are used to run the terrace extraction. You can get the example parameter file using `wget`:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/tree/master/example_parameter_files/LSDTT_Swath.param
----
Make sure that the parameter file is stored in the same place as the DEM!! This should be in the folder `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Eel_River/`
