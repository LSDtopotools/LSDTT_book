=== Running the code

==== Compiling

Before the code can be run, you must compile it. To do this you need to go to the `driver_functions` directory in the folder `LSDTopoTools_TerraceExtraction`.  Navigate to the folder using the command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_TerraceExtraction/driver_functions/
----

and compile the code with:

[source,console]
----
$ bash compile.sh
----

This may come up with some warnings, but should create the file `terraces_swath_driver.out`. You can then run the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./terraces_swath_driver.out /path/to/DEM/location/ name_of_parameter_file.param
----

For our example, the command would be:

[source,console]
----
$ ./terraces_swath_driver.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Eel_River/ LSDTT_Swath.param
----

The program should take between 10 - 40 minutes to run, depending on the size of your DEM and your processing power.  Once it is completed, you will have a number of `bil` files which you can open in a GIS of your choice.  These files will include:

. *DEM_name_filtered.bil and .hdr*: The original DEM after Perona-Malik filtering
. *DEM_name_UTM_check.csv*: A csv file with the coordinates converted into UTM so you can check them in a GIS
. *DEM_name_swath_raster.bil and .hdr*: A raster of elevations compared to the main channel in the shape of the swath profile
. *DEM_name_terrace_IDs.bil and .hdr*: A raster of terrace locations with each terrace labelled with a unique ID
. *DEM_name_terrace_relief_final.bil and .hdr*: A raster of terrace pixels labelled by elevation compared to the baseline channel.
. *DEM_name_terrace_swath_plots.txt*: A text file with the information about the terraces compared to distance along the baseline channel that can be plotted using our Python script.

An example of the terraces extracted from the South Fork Eel River catchment is shown below. You should be able to get a raster similar to this by opening the file `Eel_River_DEM_terrace_relief_final.bil` in a GIS of your choice.
