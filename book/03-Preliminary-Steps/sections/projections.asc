=== Projections and transformations

Many of our readers will be aware that our planet is well approximated as a sphere.
Most maps and computer screens, however, are flat. This causes some problems.

To locate oneself on the surface of the Earth, many navigational tools use a coordinate system based on a sphere,
first introduced by the "father or geography" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes[Eratosthenes of Cyrene].
Readers will be familiar with this system through latitude and longitude.

A coordinate system based on a sphere is called a **geographic coordinate system**.
For most of our topographic analysis routines,
a geographic coordinate system is a bit of a problem because the distance between
points is measured in angular units and these vary as a function of position on the surface of the planet.
For example, a degree of longitude is equal to 111.320 kilometers at the equator, but only 28.902 kilometers at a latitude of 75 degrees!
For our topographic analyses tools we prefer to measure distances in length rather than in angular units.

To convert locations on a the surface of a sphere to locations on a plane (e.g., a paper map or your computer screen),
a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection[map projection] is required.
All of the LSDTopoTools analysis routines work on a **projected coordinate system**.

There are many projected coordinate systems out there, but we recommend the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system[Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)] system,
since it is a widely used projection system with units of meters.

So, before you do anything with topographic data you will need to:

. Check to see if the data is in a **projected coordinate system**
. Convert any data in a *geographic coordinate systems* to a **projected coordinate system**.

Both of these tasks can be done quickly an easily with http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL] software tools.
