=== Data sources

Before you can start analyzing topography and working with topographic data,
you will need to get data and then get it into the correct format.
This page explains how to do so.

==== What data does LSDTopoToolbox take?

The LSDTopoToolbox works predominantly with raster data;
if you don't know what that is you can read about it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data.
In most cases, the raster data you will start with is a digital elevation model (DEM).
Digital elevation models (and rasters in general) come in all sorts of formats. LSDTopoToolbox works with two formats:

. ``Ascii`` format (file extension `.asc`): http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/ArcInfo+ASCII+Grid+format#ASCIIGrid.
     This format is in plain text and can be read by a text editor.
     The advantage of this format is that you can easily look at the data,
     but the disadvantage is that the file size is extremely large (compared to the other format, .flt).
. ``Float`` format (file extension `.flt` with a header file with extension `.hdr`).
      This is a binary file format meaning that you can't use a text editor to look at the data.
      The file size is greatly reduced compared to `.asc` data, however.
. ``ENVI`` bil format (file extension `.bil` with a header file with extension `.hdr`).
       This is the recommended format, because it works best with GDAL (see :ref:`gdal-notes-top`),
       and because it retains georeferencing information. For details, see: http://www.exelisvis.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html


Below you will find instructions on how to get data into the correct format
(we will focus on `.flt` and `.bil` format).

==== Downloading data

If you want to analyze topography, you should get some topographic data!
The last decade has seen incredible gains in the availability and resolution of topographic data.
Today, you can get topographic data from a number of sources. The best way to find this data is through search engines,
but below are some common sources:

* For LiDAR, two good sources are opentopography (http://www.opentopography.org/) and the U.S. Interagency Elevation Inventory (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/inventory/#).
  Other countries are not so progressive about releasing data but you could rummage around the links here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_lidar_dataset.
* For 10m data of the United States you can go to the national map viewer (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/).
  To get ordinance survey data at 10m resolution you should use Digimap (http://digimap.edina.ac.uk/digimap/home note: requires institutional subscription).
* ASTER 30m data can be obtained from NASA's reverb site (http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov).
* A number of different datasets, including ASTER, LiDAR and 5 meter resolution IfSar can be found at the USGS EarthExplorer site: http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. s
* One site that has filled and corrected 90-m DEMs from the SRTM mission is here: http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html.
