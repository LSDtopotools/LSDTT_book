=== Data sources

Before you can start analyzing topography and working with topographic data,
you will need to get data and then get it into the correct format.
This page explains how to do so.

==== What data does LSDTopoToolbox take?

The LSDTopoToolbox works predominantly with raster data;
if you don't know what that is you can read about it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data.
In most cases, the raster data you will start with is a digital elevation model (DEM).
Digital elevation models (and rasters in general) come in all sorts of formats. LSDTopoToolbox works with three formats:

.File input and output options
|===
|Data type
|file extension
|Description

|http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/ArcInfo+ASCII+Grid+format#ASCIIGrid[Ascii]
|`.asc`
|This format is in plain text and can be read by a text editor.
The advantage of this format is that you can easily look at the data,
but the disadvantage is that the file size is extremely large (compared to the other formats, .flt).

|Float
|`.flt` with a header file with extension `.hdr`.
|This is a binary file format meaning that you can't use a text editor to look at the data.
The file size is greatly reduced compared to `.asc` data, however. This format does not retain georeferencing information.

|http://www.exelisvis.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil format] 
|`.bil` with a header file with extension `.hdr`.
|**This is the recommended format**, because it works best with GDAL (see  the section <<GDAL>>),
and because it retains georeferencing information.

.Why don't we use GeoTiff?
****
https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/[GeoTIFF] is a widely used raster format that has the advantage of containing georeferencing and the raster data in a single file. 
The disadvantage is that for pass:[C++] code you need to have two libraries (`libtiff` and `libgeotiff`) installed before you can read GeoTIFF files. 
Because there are many open source, easily installed tools for converting GeoTIFF files 
(for example, the http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html[GDAL utilities] and the https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[python GDAL bindings])
we have opted for portability and not included the GeoTIFF libraries in our software. If you have GeoTIFF files, you
will need to convert them to a supported format before using LSDTopoTools. 
****

Below you will find instructions on how to get data into the correct format: 
data is delivered in a wide array of formats (e.g., ESRI bil, DEM, GeoTiff) 
and you must convert this data before it can be used by LSDTopoTools. 

==== Downloading data

If you want to analyze topography, you should get some topographic data!
The last decade has seen incredible gains in the availability and resolution of topographic data.
Today, you can get topographic data from a number of sources. The best way to find this data is through search engines,
but below are some common sources:

.Global datasets
****
There are several global topographic datasets. The oldest of these is https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/GTOPO30[gtopo30], 
which was completed in 1996 and contains ~1 km resolution global data. 
This was followed by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)]
that produced a 90 meter resolution DEM in 2003; followed by the 
https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)]
30 meter resolution global DEM in 2009. In 2014 
http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1[SRTM released a global 30 meter dataset]. 
2015 has seen the release of the http://www.geo-airbusds.com/worlddem/[WorldDEM], a 12 meter resolution topographic dataset. 

GTOPO30, SRTM and ASTER data are all freely available for download. The WorldDEM is a commercial product.
If you are looking for a global dataset at reasonable resolution that is not commercial, you will most likely choose between ASTER and SRTM. 
You can download ASTER and SRTM data at the same site and make your own comparisons, 
but ASTER has widely publicised http://www.digital-geography.com/dem-comparison-srtm-3-vs-aster-gdem-v2/#.ViS2wX6rRaQ[data quality issues]
so we recommend the SRTM 30 meter data.
