=== Data sources

Before you can start analyzing topography, you will need to get data and then get it into the correct format. 
This page explains how to do so. 

==== What data does LSDTopoToolbox take?

The LSDTopoToolbox works predominantly with raster data; 
if you don't know what that is you can read about it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data. 
In most cases, the raster data you will start with is a digital elevation model (DEM). 
Digital elevation models (and rasters in general) come in all sorts of formats. LSDTopoToolbox works with two formats:

. ``Ascii`` format (file extension `.asc`): http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/ArcInfo+ASCII+Grid+format#ASCIIGrid. 
     This format is in plaintext and can be read by a text editor. The advantage of this format is that you can easily look at the data, but the disadvantage is that the file size is extremely large (compared to the other format, .flt). 
. ``Float`` format (file extension `.flt` with a header file with extension `.hdr`). 
      This is a binary file format meaning that you can't use a text editor to look at the data. 
      The file size is greatly reduced compared to `.asc` data, however. 
. ``ENVI`` bil format (file extension `.bil` with a header file with extension `.hdr`).
       This is the recommended format, because it works best with GDAL (see :ref:`gdal-notes-top`), 
       and because it retains georeferencing information. For details, see: http://www.exelisvis.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html

      
Below you will find instructions on how to get data into the correct format 
(we will focus on `.flt` and `.bil` format).
