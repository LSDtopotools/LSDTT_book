=== Looking at your data (before you do anything with it).

You might want to have a look at your data before you do some number crunching.
To look at the data, there are a number of options.
The most common way of looking at topographic data is by using a Geographic Information System (or GIS).
The most popular commercial GIS is https://www.arcgis.com/features/[ArcGIS].
Viable open source alternatives are http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] is you want something similar to ArcGIS,
and http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/index.html[Whitebox] if you want something quite lightweight.

==== Our lightweight python mapping tools

If you would like something **really** lightweight, you can use our python mapping tools,
available here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools.
These have been designed for internal use for our group, so at this point they aren't well documented.
However if you know a bit of python you should be able to get them running.
You will need python with `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

To look at a DEM,
you will need to download `LSDMappingTools.py` and `TestMappingTools.py` from the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[Gitub repository].
The latter program just gives some examples of usage.
At this point all the plotting functions do are plot the DEM and plot a hillshade,
but if you have python working properly you can plot something in a minute or two rather than having to set up a GIS.
