== Preliminary steps

In this section we go over some of the steps required before you use the LSDTopoTools software package.
The most basic step is to get some topographic data!
Topographic data comes in a number of formats, so it is often necessary to manipulate the data a bit to get it into a form LSDTopoTools will understand.
The main ways in which you will need to manipulate the data are changing the projection of the data and changing its format.
We explain raster formats and projections first, and then move on to the tool that is best suited for projecting and transforming rasters: http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL].
Finally we describe some tools that you can use to lave a look at your raster data before you send it to LSDTopoTools.

.Quick Instructions for preliminary data processing
************************************************
. Get some data.
. Use GDAL to see if the data is in a **projected coordinate system**.
. If the data is not in a **projected coordinate system**, use GDAL to make it so.
. Convert the data to a format that LSDTopoTools can read: the preferred format is the **ENVI .bil** format.

=== The terminal and powershells

Our software works primarily through a terminal (in Linux) or poweshell (in Windows) window.
We don't have installation notes for OSX but if you manage to get it working there you will also use a terminal window.
A terminal or powershell window is an interface through which you can issue text-based commands to your computer.

In Windows, you can get powershell by searching for programs. If you are on Windows 8 (why are you on Windows 8??), use the internet to figure out how to get a powershell open.

Different flavors of Linux have different methods in which to open a terminal,
but if you are using Ubuntu you can type kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Alt]+kbd:[T] or you can find it in the application menu.

On other flavors of Linux (for example, those using a Gnome or KDE desktop) you can often get the terminal window by right-clicking anywhere on the desktop and selecting `terminal` option.
In KDE a terminal is also called a "Konsole".

Once you have opened a terminal window you will see a command prompt. In linux the command prompt will look a bit like this:

[source,console]
----
user@server $
----

or just:

[source,console]
----
$
----

whereas the powershell will look a bit like this:

[source,console]
----
PS C:\Home >
----

Once you start working with our tools you will quickly be able to open a terminal window (or powershell) in your sleep.

=== Summary

You should now have some idea as to how to get your hands on some topographic data,
and how to use GDAL to transform it into something that LSDTopoTools can use.
