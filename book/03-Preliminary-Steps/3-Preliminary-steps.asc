== Preliminary steps

In this section we go over some of the steps required before you use the LSDTopoTools software package.
The most basic step is to get some topographic data!
Topographic data comes in a number of formats, so it is often necessary to manipulate the data a bit to get it into a form LSDTopoTools will understand.
The main ways in which you will need to manipulate the data are changing the projection of the data and changing its format.
We explain raster formats and projections first, and then move on to the tool that is best suited for projecting and transforming rasters: http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL].
Finally we describe some tools that you can use to lave a look at your raster data before you send it to LSDTopoTools.

.Quick Instructions for preliminary data processing
************************************************
. Get some data.
. Use GDAL to see if the data is in a **projected coordinate system**.
. If the data is not in a **projected coordinate system**, use GDAL to make it so.
. Convert the data to a format that LSDTopoTools can read: the preferred format is the **ENVI .bil** format.

=== Summary

You should now have some idea as to how to get your hands on some topographic data,
and how to use GDAL to transform it into something that LSDTopoTools can use.
