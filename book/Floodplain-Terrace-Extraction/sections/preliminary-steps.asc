=== Preliminary steps

==== Getting the channel head file

Before the floodplain/terrace extraction algorithm can be run, you must create a channel network for your DEM.  This can be done using the <<Channel extraction>> algorithms within LSDTopoTools.  There are several channel extraction algorithms which you can choose from: for more details please refer to the <<Channel extraction>> section.  Once you have run the channel extraction algorithm, you must make sure that the `csv` file with the channel head locations is placed in the same folder as your DEM.

==== Finding the correct window size

Before we can run the floodplain/terrace extraction algorithm, we need to calculate the correct window size for calculating slope across the DEM.  This is used to calculate the thresholds for floodplain/terrace identification.  Please refer to the <<Selecting A Window Size>> section for information on how to calculate a window size for your DEM.  We suggest a value of around 6 m for 1 m resolution DEMs, and a value of 15 m for 10 m resoluton DEMs.
