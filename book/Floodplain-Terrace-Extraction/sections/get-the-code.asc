=== Get the code for floodplain and terrace extraction

The code for floodplain/terrace extraction can be found in our GitHub repository.  This repository contains code for identifying floodplains based on relief relative to the nearest channel, and getting terraces along a channel swath profile.

==== Clone the GitHub repository

First navigate to the folder where you will keep the GitHub repository.  If you installed LSDTopoTools using the vagrant distribution, then this should be the `Git_projects` folder. To navigate to this folder in a UNIX terminal use the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
----

You can use the command `pwd` to check you are in the right folder.  Once you are in this folder, you can clone the repository from the https://github.com[GitHub website]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainTerraceExtraction.git
----
==== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainTerraceExtraction/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.
