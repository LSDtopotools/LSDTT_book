== Setting up on Windows

IMPORTANT: You should only do this if you are some kind of Windows purist (does such a thing exist?). LSDTopoTools works best in Linux and at the moment the best way to get a linux server working within your Windows machine is to use Vagrant. Instructions can be found here: <<Installing LSDTopoTools on a Windows machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>. 

For the kind of scientific tools we will be using, Windows can sometimes be a bit difficult,
since many scientific developers work in Linux and so installation for their software is easiest in a Linux environment.
However, you can get Windows to behave a bit like Linux which will make your life easier for the purposes of installing the required software for the examples here.

Alternatively, you can <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,get a "virtual" Linux machine running on your Windows machine>>.

*Let me type that in bold text: it will be far easier to do things in a Linux environment than in a Windows environment.
I strongly encourage you to <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,build a virtual machine>>.*

=== Summary

By now you should be able to pull up a powershell and call the essential programs we will be working with in this course.
