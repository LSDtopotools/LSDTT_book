== Setting up on Windows

For the kind of scientific tools we will be using, Windows can sometimes be a bit difficult,
since many scientific developers work in Linux and so installation for their software is easiest in a Linux environment.
However, you can get Windows to behave a bit like Linux which will make your life easier for the purposes of installing the required software for the examples here.

Alternatively, you can <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,get a "virtual" Linux machine running on your Windows machine>>.

*Let me type that in bold text: it will be far easier to do things in a Linux environment than in a Windows environment.
I strongly encourage you to <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,build a virtual machine>>.*
