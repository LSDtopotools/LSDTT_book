=== Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine

The header of this section is a bit misleading,
what you are really going to do is use software to create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual] version of Linux within your Windows computer.

IMPORTANT: Only do this if you want total control of your Linux enviroment. If you want us to do everything for you, read the instructions on <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant>> and don't continue reading this section!

There are a number of options, popular ones include:

  * http://www.parallels.com/uk/[Parallels] This software is proprietary.
  * http://www.vmware.com/[VMWare] There are several flavours of this. The free version is VMware Player.
  * https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] This is open source.

Here I'll walk you through setting up Linux using VMware.
It just happened to be the one I tried first and it works, please do not take this as an endorsement.
One disadvantage is it doesn't seem to have an Apple version. If you use Apple you'll need to try to go through a similar process using https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox],
which does have a version for Mac operating systems.

But, here is how you set up the VMware player.
You will need a reasonable amount of storage (say at least 30GB: you will not be able to get this back!) 
and RAM (say at least 4 GB, but 8GB is better...note that this is only used when the virtual machine is on)
A very old computer probably won't work.
If you've got a computer purchased in the last few years things will probably be fine.
Note that the virtual machine permanently takes up some portion of your hard disk (you can release this protion back to your windows machine if you uninstall the virtual machine).

. First, download VMware player. The download is currently here: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0.
. Run the installation package. Brew a cup of tea while you wait for it to install. http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hibernian[Maybe surf the internet a bit].
. **BEFORE** you set up a virtual machine, you will need to download a linux operating system!
.. We are going to use http://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], just because it is stable, popular and has good documentation.
WARNING: I first attempted an installation with 64-bit Ubuntu, but it turns out my computer doesn't allow guest 64 bit operating systems.
To fix this I just downloaded the 32 bit version of Ubuntu, which worked. However, many of my students have sucessfully installed 65 bit Ubuntu. 
.. Find the downloads link and download the latest version. It will be an `iso` disk image. This will take a while. Put that time to https://www.youtube.com/user/HibernianTV[good use].
. Once that finishes downloading, you can set up your virtual box. First, open VMware Player.
+
WARNING: These menus seem to change with new releases, so just try to pick the most sensible menu options if they don't match the instructions. 
+
.. Now click on the "Create a New Virtual Machine" option.
. It will ask you how you want to install the operating system. Tell it you want to use the Ubuntu disk image you just downloaded:
. You will need to add some username information, and then you will have to pick a location for the Virtual Machine. I made a folder called `c:\Ubuntu` for it:
. Now allocate disk space to the virtual machine. **This disk space cannot be used by your windows operating system!!**. 
I decided to use a single file to store the disk since it should be faster.
. The next page will say it is ready to create the virtual machine, but it has a default Memory (in my case 1 GB) allocated. 
I wanted more memory so I clicked on the customize hardware button:
This allowed me to increase the memory to 2GB. 
+
NOTE: Memory will be used when the virtual  machine is on, but when not in use the memory will revert to your original operating system.
+
NOTE: You can change the amount of memory allocated to your virtual machine by changing the virtual machine settings from the VMware start page. 
+
NOTE: The size of the DEM you can analyse will be limited by your memory. Give the virtual machine as much memory as you can spare if you are running analysis on big DEMs. 
+
. You might be asked to install some VMware Linux tools. You should do this, as some things won't work if it isn't installed.
. Installing the operating system within the virtual machine will take ages. You might schedule this task for your lunch hour, which is what I did.
My chicken shawarma wrap was delicious, thank you for asking. 
. When Ubuntu has installed, it will look for software updates. You should install these. This will also take ages. Maybe you have a http://www.iain-banks.net/science-fiction/[book to read]?
. Finally, you should be aware that the default keyboard layout is US. Getting UBUNTU to recognize a different keyboard is a bit of a pain.
.. First go to system settings.
.. Then click on language support.
.. It will need to install some stuff.
.. Go to text entry.
.. In the lower left corner click on the `+` button.
.. Add your country's input source.
