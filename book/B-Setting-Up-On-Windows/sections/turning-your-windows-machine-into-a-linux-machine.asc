=== Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine

The header of this section is a bit misleading,
what you are really going to do is use software to create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual] version of Linux within your Windows computer.

There are a number of options, popular ones include:

  * http://www.parallels.com/uk/[Parallels] This software is proprietary.
  * http://www.vmware.com/[VMWare] There are several flavours of this. The free version is VMware Player.
  * https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] This is open source.

Here I'll walk you through setting up Linux using VMware.
It just happened to be the one I tried first and it works, please do not take this as an endorsement.
One disadvantage is it doesn't seem to have an Apple version. If you use Apple you'll need to try to go through a similar process using `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_,
which does have a version for Mac operating systems.

But, here is how you set up the VMware player.
You will need a reasonable amount of storage and RAM. So a very old computer won't work.
If you've got a computer purchased in the last few years things will probably be fine.
You will also need a reasonable amount of storage on your hard disk.
The virtual machine permanently takes up some component of your hard disk.

. First, download VMware player. The download is currently `here <https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0>`_.
. Run the installation package. Brew a cup of tea while you wait for it to install. `Maybe surf the internet a bit <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hibernian>`_.
. **BEFORE** you set up a virtual machine, you will need to download a linux operating system!
.. We are going to use `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_, just because it is stable, popular and has good documentation.
WARNING: I first attempted an installation with 64-bit Ubuntu, but it turns out my computer doesn't allow guest 64 bit operating systems.
         To fix this I just downloaded the 32 bit version of Ubuntu, which worked.
.. Find the downloads link and download the latest version. It will be an `iso` disk image. This will take a while. Put that time to `good use <https://www.youtube.com/user/HibernianTV>`_.
. Once that finishes downloading, you can set up your virtual box. First, open VMware Player.
.. Now click on the "Create a New Virtual Machine" option.
. It will ask you how you want to install the operating system. Tell it you want to use the Ubuntu disk image you just downloaded:
. You will need to add some username information, and then you will have to pick a location for the Virtual Machine. I made a folder called `c:\Ubuntu` for it:
. Now allocate disk space to the virtual machine. **This disk space cannot be used by your windows operating system!!**. I decided to use a single file to store the disk since it should be faster:
. The next page will say it is ready to create the virtual machine, but it has a default Memory (in my case 1GM) allocated. I wanted more memory so I clicked on the customize hardware button:
This allowed me to increase the memory to 2GB. Note that this will be used when the virtual  machine is on, but when not in use the memory will revert to your original operating system.
. You might be asked to install some VMware Linux tools. You should do this, as some things won't work if it isn't installed.
. Installing the operating system within the virtual machine will take ages. You might schedule this task for your lunch hour, which is what I did.
. When Ubuntu has installed, it will look for software updates. You should install these. This will also take ages. Maybe you have a book to read?
. Finally, you should be aware that the default keyboard layout is US. Getting a different keyboard is a bit of a pain.
.. First go to system settings.
.. Then click on language support.
.. It will need to install some stuff.
.. Go to text entry.
.. In the lower left corner click on the `+` button.
.. Add your country's input source.
