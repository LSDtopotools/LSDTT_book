=== Working with the powershell

Much of what we do will be through a powershell window. 
This is a text-based interface into your windows system that allows you to install software and run scripts and code.
It functions like a linux terminal.

First of all, you need to get a powershell running. On my windows version, you just type *powershell* into the bit of Windows where you searh for files or programs (it varies based on what windows system you are using). 
You should be able to find a way to get a powershell on your version of windows through the power of the internet. 

==== Starting a powershell session

First, you will need to open an administrator powershell. 
In your powershell window, type

  PS> Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs
  
NOTE: The `PS>` denotes the powershell propmpt.

WARNING: You might not have administrator priviliges on your computer.
In that case you will need to convince the administrator to install everything for you, 
or you can ask them to install a linux virtual machine, which is described in the section <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>.
