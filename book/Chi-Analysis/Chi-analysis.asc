=== Chi analysis

In the late 1800s, G.K. Gilbert proposed that bedrock channel incision should be proportional to topographic gradients and the amount of water flowing in a channel.
Since then, many geomorpholgists have attempted to extract information about erosion rates from channel profiles. 
Chi analysis is a method of extracting information from channel profiles that attempts to compare channels with different discharges first proposed by Leigh Royden and colleagues at MIT.
LSDTopoTools has a number of tools for performing chi analysis.

=== Summary

You should now be able to extract some simple topographic metrics from a DEM using our Driver_analysis program.
