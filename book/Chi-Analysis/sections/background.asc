=== Background to chi analysis

Here is an equation
latexmath:[sqrt(4) = 2]

latexmath:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]

stem:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

Chi analysis, or stem:[\chi] analysis, is a means of normalizing channel gradient for either drainage area or discharge.

Chi analysis is a method for examining channel profiles.
If you are familiar with chi analysis, you can skip ahead to the section <<Get and compile the chi analysis tools>>.
This section covers the background to the method, and why it is useful.
