=== Get the chi analysis tools

First navigate to the folder where you will keep your repositories.
In this example, that folder is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.
In a terminal window, go there with the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the `pwd` command to make sure you are in the correct directory.
If you don't have the directory, use `mkdir` to make it.

==== Clone the code from Git

Now, clone the repository from https://github.com[GitHub]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014.git
----

===== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Compile the code

Okay, now you should have the code. You will still be sitting in the directory
`/home/LSDTT_repositories/`, so navigate up to the directory `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/`.

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014
$ cd driver_functions_MuddChi2014
----

There are a number of makefiles (thse with extension `.make` in this folder).
These do a number of different things that will be explained later in this chapter.
We will compile them as we go through the various different types of chi analysis.

==== Get some example data

We are going to use example data from the Mandakini River in Northern India.
This river was the focus of a study by Rahul Devrani and others, you can find it here:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL063784/full (the paper is open access). 

Again, we want to make sure our data is arranged somewhere sensible. 
Make a directory for datasets and perhaps a folder specific to India. 
Again, you don't need to follow the same naming conventions as in these examples,
but you will have to remember the directory names!

I would open a second terminal window (one should already be open in the *driver_functions_MuddChi2014* folder)
and navigate to the data folder:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_Data/India/
----

The SRTM data from the catchment is stored on the data repository at GitHub:
https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets.

You probably don't want to clone this repository since it contains a lot of DEMs, 
so why don't you just download the relevant files directly:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Mandakini.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Mandakini.hdr
----

We are also going to use a parameter file, which can be grabbed from Github:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/example_parameter_files/Mandakini.driver
----

Okay, you are now ready to move on to the examples.
