=== Get the chi analysis tools

IMPORTANT: If you have used our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles] you already have this code in the directory
`/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014` and the test data is in `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data`.

First navigate to the folder where you will keep your repositories.
In this example, that folder is called `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects`.
In a terminal window, go there with the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
----

You can use the `pwd` command to make sure you are in the correct directory.
If you don't have the directory, use `mkdir` to make it.

==== Clone the code from Git

Now, clone the repository from https://github.com[GitHub]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014.git
----

If you have used our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles] and vagrant, you can update the existing repository with:
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014
$ git pull origin master
----

===== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Compile the code

Okay, now you should have the code. If you have downloaded or cloned the code yourself, you will still be sitting in the directory
`/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects`, so navigate up to the directory `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/`.

If you are using our vagrant distribution the code will be automatically cloned and you can get it by going directly to the appropriate folder:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/
----

There are a number of makefiles (thse with extension `.make` in this folder). You can have a look at all of them by running the command:

[source,console]
----
$ ls *.make
----

These makefiles do a number of different things that will be explained later in this chapter.
We will compile them as we go through the various different types of chi analysis.

==== Get some example data

IMPORTANT: If you are using our *vagrantfiles* then the data is already in the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` directory, and you don't need to download anything. 

We are going to use example data from the Mandakini River in Northern India.
This river was the focus of a study by Rahul Devrani and others, you can find it here:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL063784/full (the paper is open access). 

Again, we want to make sure our data is arranged somewhere sensible. 
Make a directory for datasets and perhaps a folder specific to India. 
Again, you don't need to follow the same naming conventions as in these examples,
but you will have to remember the directory names!

I would open a second terminal window (one should already be open in the *driver_functions_MuddChi2014* folder)
and navigate to the data folder:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
----

If you use vagrant, the data is already there. If you don't, then you can grab the data from the web. 
The SRTM data from the catchment is stored on the data repository at GitHub:
https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets.

You probably don't want to clone this repository since it contains a lot of DEMs, 
so why don't you just download the relevant files directly:

[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Mandakini.bil
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/Mandakini.hdr
----

We are also going to use a parameter file, which comes with the cloned `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014` repository. It is called `Example_Mudd2014.driver` and is loaced in the `driver_functions_MuddChi2014` directory.
