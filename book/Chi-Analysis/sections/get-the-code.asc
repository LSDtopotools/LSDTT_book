=== Get the chi analysis tools

First navigate to the folder where you will keep your repositories.
In this example, that folder is called `/home/LSDTT_repositories`.
In a terminal window, go there with the `cd` command:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /home/LSDTT_repositories/
----

You can use the `pwd` command to make sure you are in the correct directory.
If you don't have the directory, use `mkdir` to make it.

==== Clone the code from Git

Now, clone the repository from https://github.com[GitHub]:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014.git
----

===== Alternatively, get the zipped code

If you don't want to use _git_, you can download a zipped version of the code:

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/archive/master.zip
$ gunzip master.zip
----

NOTE: https://github.com[GitHub] zips all repositories into a file called `master.zip`,
so if you previously downloaded a zipper repository this will overwrite it.

==== Compile the code

Okay, now you should have the code. You will still be sitting in the directory
`/home/LSDTT_repositories/`, so navigate up to the directory `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/`.

[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/LSDTT_repositories/
$ cd LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014
$ cd driver_functions_MuddChi2014
----

There are a number of makefiles (thse with extension `.make` in this folder).
These do a number of different things that will be explained later in this chapter.
We will compile them as we go through the various different types of chi analysis.
