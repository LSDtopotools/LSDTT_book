== Setting up on MacOS

It is possible to run **LSDTopoTools** natively on MacOS, because they run on Linux and MacOS is built on top of Linux. However, we are not even going to tell you how to do that since it is 1000x easier just to set up a Linux server in your MacOS machine using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. Instructions can be found here: <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>. 

=== Looking at the data

If you have used our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant, instructions on setting up using Vagrant>>, then your MacOS machine will be able to see files (rasters, point data, paramfiles) generated by you Linux server. To look at these you should have:

. A GIS. http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] is a good, ope-source GIS. You can http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html[download it from here]
. Python. We strongly recommend using http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda] to install python. Our plotting scripts use **Python 2.7** so you should download that one. Once miniconda is downloaded, go into a http://www.howtogeek.com/210147/how-to-open-terminal-in-the-current-os-x-finder-location/[terminal window] and run the following:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda install scipy
$ conda install pandas
$ conda install matplotlib
$ conda install gdal
$ conda install spyder
$ conda install pyqt=4.10 -f
----
+
The last command is because spyder and matplotlib use conflicting versions of something called PyQt (as of September 2016).
+
. A text editor. We recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets] but there are many other choices. https://atom.io/[Atom] also works on MacOS.

IMPORTANT: Even though QGIS and python both have Linux installers, don't install them on your Linux server for use with LSDTopoTools. This is because we use these programs to look at data, and our vagrant server cannot produce windows. You should do this n your native operating system.
