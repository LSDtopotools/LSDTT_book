== Introduction

=== What is this software?

http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] is a software package designed to analyze landscapes for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, ecology and allied fields. 
It is not intended as a substitute for a GIS, but rather is designed to be a research and analysis tool that produces *reproducible* data. 
The motivations behind its development were:

. To serve as a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.
. To serve as a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.
. To serve as a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes (for hydrology, geomorphology and hydrology).
. To improve the *speed* and *performance* of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).
. To enable **reproducible** topographic analysis in the research context.

The toolbox is organized around objects, which are used to store and manipulate specific kinds of data,
and driver functions, which users write to interface with the objects.

The http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html[Source code documentation site]
tells you all about the objects: these pages get into the nitty gritty of the computational algorithms
and I only recommend looking at them if you plan on developing the code.

For most readers of this documentation,
you can exist in blissful ignorance of the implementation and simply stay on these pages to learn how to
use the software for your topographic analysis needs.

=== Why don't we just use ArcMap/QGIS? It has topographic analysis tools.

One of the things our group does as geomorphologists is try to understand the physics and evolution of the Earth's surface by analyzing topography.
Many geomorphologists will take some topographic data and perform a large number of steps to produce and original analysis.
Our code is designed to automate such steps as well as make these steps reproducible.
If you send another geomorphologist your code and data they should be able to exactly reproduce your analysis.
This is not true of work done in ArcMap or other GIS systems. ArcMap and QGIS are good at many things! 
But they are not that great for analysis that can easily be reproduced by other groups. 
Our software was built to do the following:

. LSDTopoTools automates things that would be slow in ArcMap.
. LSDTopoTools is designed to be *reproducible*: it does not depend on one individuals mouse clicks.
. LSDTopoTools uses the latest fast algorithms so it is much faster than ArcMap.
. LSDTopoTools has topographic analysis algorithms designed and coded by us or designed by someone else but
coded by us soon after publication that are not available in ArcMap.
. LSDTopoTools contains some elements of landscape evolution models which cannot be done in ArcMap.



=== Quickstart for those who don't want to read the first 4 chapters

Some readers will already be familiar with the steps required to get LSDTopoTools working.
Here is succinct overview of what you need to do to prepare for your first analysis:

.Quick Instructions for preliminary data processing
************************************************
. Make sure you can open a *terminal or powershell window*.
. Make sure you have a *pass:[C++] compiler* (we use pass:[g++]) and the *make tool* installed.
. Make sure you have *git* installed.
. Make sure you have the *GDAL utilities* installed and working.
. Get some topographic data and convert it to *projected coordinates* (we prefer WGS1984 UTM projections).
. Make sure you have *python* with *scipy* including *numpy* and *matplotlib* working on your computer.
************************************************

If all of the above steps make sense, you can probably just implement them and move on to the <<First analysis>> chapter.
Otherwise, you should continue reading from here.
