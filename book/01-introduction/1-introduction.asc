== Introduction

=== What is this software?

http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] is a software package designed to analyze landscapes for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, ecology and allied fields. 
It is not intended as a substitute for a GIS, but rather is designed to be a research and analysis tool that produces **reproducible** data. 
The motivations behind its development were:

. To serve as a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.
. To serve as a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.
. To serve as a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes (for hydrology, geomorphology and ecology).
. To improve the *speed* and *performance* of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).
. To enable **reproducible** topographic analysis in the research context.

The toolbox is organized around objects, which are used to store and manipulate specific kinds of data,
and driver functions, which users write to interface with the objects.

.Looking at the source code (most users will not need to bother with this)
************************************************
The http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html[Source code documentation site]
tells you all about the objects: these pages get into the nitty gritty of the computational algorithms
and I only recommend looking at them if you plan on developing the code.
************************************************

For most readers of this documentation,
you can exist in blissful ignorance of the implementation and simply stay on these pages to learn how to
use the software for your topographic analysis needs.

=== Why don't we just use ArcMap/QGIS? It has topographic analysis tools.

One of the things our group does as geomorphologists is try to understand the physics and evolution of the Earth's surface by analyzing topography.
Many geomorphologists will take some topographic data and perform a large number of steps to produce and original analysis.
Our code is designed to automate such steps as well as make these steps reproducible.
If you send another geomorphologist your code and data they should be able to exactly reproduce your analysis.
This is not true of work done in ArcMap or other GIS systems. ArcMap and QGIS are good at many things! 
But they are not that great for analysis that can easily be reproduced by other groups. 
Our software was built to do the following:

. **LSDTopoTools** automates things that would be slow in ArcMap or QGIS.
. **LSDTopoTools** is designed to be *reproducible*: it does not depend on one individuals mouse clicks.
. **LSDTopoTools** uses the latest fast algorithms so it is much faster than ArcMap or QGIS for many things (for example, flow routing).
. **LSDTopoTools** has topographic analysis algorithms designed and coded by us or designed by someone else but
coded by us soon after publication that are not available in ArcMap or QGIS.
. **LSDTopoTools** contains some elements of landscape evolution models which cannot be done in ArcMap or QGIS.

=== Quickstart for those who don't want to read the first 4 chapters

We have prepared **LSDTopoTools** to be used in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[Virtual Machine] so that you should just have to install two bits of software, 
https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] and https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. 
After that, you get a small file from one of our repositories that manages all the installation for you. More details are available in the section 
<<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant>>. 

.The most painless way to get LSDTopoTools working (this works on any operating system!!)
************************************************
. Make sure you can open a *terminal or powershell window*. Here are instructions for http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/25581-windows-powershell-open-windows-10-a.html[Windows], http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/get-more-out-of-os-x-terminal-3608274/[OS X], and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal[Ubuntu]. Other linux systems will be similar to Ubuntu. 
. You should have at least 5Gb of storage on your computer available. 
. Install https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox].
. Install https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant].
. Make a directory to hold your vagrant boxes. I call this directory `VagrantBoxes`
. Inside this directory, make a directory called `LSDTopoTools`. 
. Make another directory where you will put some information about your vagrant machine.
We have used an http://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] operating system. Call this something sensible, like `Ubuntu32` or `MyLinuxBox` or `UbuntuBox` or something.
I will assume you have called it `UbuntuBox` for now. 
. Go into the folder `UbuntuBox`. Download one of the files from https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles. The files with **32** are 32-bit systems, 
whereas the ones with **64** are 64-bit operating systems. Your computer is almost certainly 64 bit but most computers have a default setting not to allow 64 bit guest operating systems. So unless you http://superuser.com/questions/866962/why-does-virtualbox-only-have-32-bit-option-no-64-bit-option-on-windows-7[know how to enable 64 bit guest operating systems], choose a 32 bit version.   
. When you have downloaded the file, rename it `vagrantfile`. 
. In a terminal window or powershell, go to the folder with the `vagrantfile` (here in the folder `UbuntuBox`) and type  `vagrant up`. 
. Go and read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(novel)[a book] or http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hibernian[browse the internet] because this will take some time. 
The first time you do this https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] will need to download ~0.5Gb of stuff. Hopefully you have a fast internet connection!!
. When it finishes, you can log on to your server, which is a fully function Linux operating system, with all the necessary software installed, sitting in your host computer. Yay!
. You need to log on to the server so you can do some **LSDTopoTools** analyses. If your host machine is Linux or OSX, just type `vagrant ssh`. 
If your host machine is Windows, you need to download http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[putty.exe] and log in with a host name of **127.0.0.1** and a port of **2222**.

If you have your own Linux server and you like doing things by hand, here is succinct overview of what you need to do to prepare for your first analysis:

.Quick Instructions for if you don't want to use Vagrant
************************************************
. Why don't you want to use Vagrant?? You have your own Linux workstation? Okay, that is a good reason. What about you? You use Windows? MacOS? Don't be silly. Use Vagrant.
. Make sure you can open a *terminal or powershell window*.
. Make sure you have a *pass:[C++] compiler* (we use pass:[g++]) and the *make tool* installed.
. Make sure you have *git* installed.
. Make sure you have the *GDAL utilities* installed and working.
. Get some topographic data and convert it to *projected coordinates* (we prefer WGS1984 UTM projections).
. Make sure you have *python* with *scipy* including *numpy* and *matplotlib* working on your computer.
************************************************

If all of the above steps make sense, you can probably just implement them and move on to the <<Running your first analysis,First Analysis>> chapter.
Otherwise, you should continue reading from here.
