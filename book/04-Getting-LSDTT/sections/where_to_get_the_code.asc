=== Where to get the code

Okay, now to actually get the code! There are several versions floating around.
**They are not all the same!** The best two ways to get the code both involve downloading the code from https://github.com[github].

One way to do this is to go into a repository and download the repository as a `.zip` file.

If, however, you are planning on keeping up with updates, it is probably better to use the software `git` to get the code.

NOTE: If you have used our vagrant installation, you will automatically have several of our repositories whoich you can update with the command `vagrant up`.


==== Latest release versions on GitHub

We post the latest release versions of the software on https://github.com[GitHub].

The github site is: https://github.com/LSDtopotools.
This site contains a number of offerings: documentation, notes, automation scripts, plotting scripts and other goodies.

==== CSDMS

When we publish papers that use new algorithms, we tend to post the code on the
Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System website, found here: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page.

These versions are the ones used in the publications, so they are representative of the code used in the papers but not the latest versions.
Currently our http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page[CSDMS] offerings are:

* A tool for examining river profiles: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:Chi_analysis_tools
* A tool for finding channel heads: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DrEICH_algorithm
* A tool for measuring hillslope length: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:Hilltop_flow_routing
* A tool for finding bedrock outcrops: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:SurfaceRoughness
