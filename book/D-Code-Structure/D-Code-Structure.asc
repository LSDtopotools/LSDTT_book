== Code Structure: Written by hacks, for hacks

You can happily use LSDTopoTools oblivious to the inner-workings of the code and how it all connects together to produce a suite of topographic analyses at your disposal. Ignorance is, as they say, bliss. No knowledge of Classes, Drivers, Objects, and so on, is needed to run the basic analyses supplied in the distribution of this software. However, you might wish to write your own driver functions, and may even be considering contributing to the core parts of the code. This way you can make your topographic techniques and algorithmic awesomeness available to like-minded geoscientists. Earlier, we mentioned breifly how the code is structured in the main body of this documentation. For those intrepid interrogators of empirical inquisition who have made it four levels down into the Appendix section, first of all, we salute you, and we reward you with a deeper look into how the code is structured, should you wish to contribute your own additions to the repository.

=== Source Files: Drivers, Headers, and Implementaions.

There are two main parts of the LSDTopoTools source code: the driver functions and the core component source files. The core files contain the implementations of topographic analyses, and many other functions for creating rasters, sorting data, performin file operations, writing output, and so on.  All the core source files are prefixed with ``LSDSomeFile.*pp``. They also come in pairs: a ``LSDSomeClass.cpp`` source file comes with a ``LSDSomeClass.hpp`` header file. The header file describes the interface to a parituclar source file. In other words, ``LSDSomeClass.hpp`` tells us what all the methods and data structures of a particular source file (``LSD*.cpp``) are. For functions (or class methods to be precise...) the header file tells us what type of parameters the functions take as arguments, and what data types (if any) these functions return. They also describe how data structures are stored. For example, we could look in ``LSDRaster.hpp`` to see how the data members of a Raster are defined. We would see that an ``LSDRaster`` object has some meta-data telling us about the extent and coordinates of the the raster data, and an array that stores each pixel value in the raster. It would also tell us which functions (methods) would return information about the ``LSDRaster`` object. If we wanted to know the number of rows in a raster object we would see in the header file there is a ``getNRows()`` function, and so on. The ``*.cpp`` files tell us _how_ these functions are implemented, e.g. what exactly each function does when parameters are passed to it, and how it maniplulates the data stored with the object.

In general, although it is not required, we have kept one `Class` to one pair of header and implementation files. (Although there are a couple of exceptions to this). So in the ``LSDRaster.hpp`` and ``LSDRaster.cpp`` core files, you will find the declaration and implementation of the ``LSDRaster`` class, respectively. In short, ``hpp`` tells us what is there and how to use it, ``cpp`` tells us how it works. For a full description of all the LSDTopoTools objects and classes you can visit the automatically generated doxygen documentation.

The driver files are separated off into their own folder(s) and as their name suggests, they are responsible for driving a particular analysis by calling on different objects and functions defined in the core source files. The core ``LSDFooBar``-type files we talked about previously don't actually do much on their own -- they are just a bunch of class data structures and methods. This is where the driver files come in: driver files are written to perform a certain kind of topographic analysis or model simulation using some form of input data created by you, the user. Driver files call upon different parts of the object files to perform topographic analyses. An example driver file may call upon ``LSDRaster`` to create a Raster object to store data from an input DEM, then it might pass this ``LSDRaster`` object to ``LSDFlowInfo`` to calculate the flow routing paths in the raster, and so on, until we have completed a useful analysis and written some output data to analyse. 

Since there is such a variety of functions defined in the source code, there are potentially hundreds if not thousands of possible analyses that could be performed with the code. The driver files provided with the TopoTools distribution are designed to accomplish some of the more common topographic analysis tasks, e.g. extracting basins from a raster, calculating the location of channel heads in a landscape, running a chi-analysis on river channels, or extracting swath profiles, and so on. However, you are free to write your own driver files of course! What's more, they provide an exact record of the analysis you have just done, and so are inherrently reproducible if you want to share your findings with others. 

TIP: Another way to think of drivers, if you are familiar with C or C++ programming, is that they contain the ``int main() { }`` bit of a typical program. I.e. the main workflow of a program.
