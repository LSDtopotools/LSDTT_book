= LSDTopoTools for Geomorphology, Hydrology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences

Welcome to documentation for Land Surface Dynamics Topographic Tools Geomorphology, Hydrology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences.
In this book you will get instructions on how to set up and use the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] software package.
The documentation also contains information about the algorithms used in the software and links to associated publications.

== Reading these pages as html

Once these documents are in a more complete state, they will live in http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/smudd[Simon M Mudd's] website under the software heading.
In the meantime you can look at the old documentation.

== How To generate the book

You will need to have https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] installed on your computer,
as well as https://rubygems.org/[RubyGems]. You can learn how to install these in the appendices of this book
(which you should be able to read in a text editor or on Github).

You then should install the ruby package `bundler` using

[source,console]
----
$ sudo gem install bundler
----

You also need to clone the files into the directory of your choice from Github.
Once you have bundler installed, you can build the book with:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----

This will build html and pdf versions of the book. You can also build just the html with

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

WARNING: The build process will make a folder called `images` in the root directory,
which on some systems must be deleted before new builds.

=== Quick build asciidoctor

You can also quickly generate the document by installing http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], and then running it on the `LSDTT_Book.asc` file:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo gem install asciidoctor
$ asciidoctor LSDTT_Book.asc
----

WARNING: This quick generation will give you the text and cross-linking, but the images will not be linked.
For images to be properly linked you need to run `bundle exec` (see above).
