= LSDTopoTools for Geomorphology, Hydrology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences

Welcome to documentation for Land Surface Dynamics Topographic Tools Geomorphology, Hydrology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences.
In this book you will get instructions on how to set up and use the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] software package.
The documentation also contains information about the algorithms used in the software and links to associated publications.

== Reading these pages as html

Once these documents are in a more complete state, they will live in http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/smudd[Simon M Mudd's] website under the software heading.
In the meantime you can look at the old documentation.

== How To generate the book

You will need to have https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] installed on your computer,
as well as https://rubygems.org/[RubyGems]. You can learn how to install these in the appendices of this book
(which you should be able to read in a text editor or on Github).

You then should install the ruby package `bundler` using

[source,console]
----
$ sudo gem install bundler
----

You also need to clone the files into the directory of your choice from Github.
Once you have bundler installed, you can build the book with:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----

This will build html and pdf versions of the book. You can also build just the html with

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

WARNING: The build process will make a folder called `images` in the root directory,
which on some systems must be deleted before new builds.

WARNING: If you are looking at the html pages,
you should be aware that the mathematical rendering might not work on older browsers.
If you stubbornly resist updating your browser, you can see the math in the pdf version of the book. 

=== Quick build asciidoctor

You can also quickly generate the document by installing http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], and then running it on the `LSDTT_Book.asc` file:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo gem install asciidoctor
$ asciidoctor LSDTT_Book.asc
----

WARNING: This quick generation will give you the text and cross-linking, but the images will not be linked.
For images to be properly linked you need to run `bundle exec` (see above).

== If you are making changes to this book

You can ignore this unless you are helping write the book and have push permission. 

I (SMM) do not want any messy merging conflicts! To avoid this please keep the *master* and *gh-pages* seperate on your computer!

. When checking out the code, check them out into two directories:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book.git master
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book.git gh-pages
----
+
. In the gh-pages directory, check out the gh-pages branch and get rid of the master branch:
+
----
$ cd gh-pages
$ git checkout origin/gh-pages -b gh-pages
$ git branch -d master
----
+
. Now, go back to the master branch, you can make changes there. 

. When you commit changes to the master branch and you want to update the website, commit and push changes, then run bundle:
+
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/LSDTT_book/master/
$ git commit -m "My latest commit" .
$ git push -u origin master
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
. Now copy any new image files to the /images folder in the gh-pages branch (you will need to git add them), 
and rename *NMDM.html* to *index.html* and copy to the gh-pages folder. 
+
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/LSDTT_book/gh-pages/
$ cd images
$ git add <filenames of new images>
$ cd ..
$ git commit "updating website" .
----
+
. Now push the changes to the gh-pages branch
+
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
+
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/LSDTT_book/gh-pages/
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
----
